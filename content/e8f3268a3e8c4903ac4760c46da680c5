<p>A common thing you find in agile projects is that the development
  team sits in a single open team room. It was advocated early on in
  Extreme Programming and called out as one of primary practices in
  the second edition. Agilists favor a open team room as it promotes
  lots of informal and deep communication between people on the
  team.</p><img height = '471' src = 'images/teamRoom/teamRoomBeijing.jpg' width = '800'></img>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Software development is an intense exercise in
    collaboration. An open space encourages regular conversations and
    interactions between people. You can see what everyone's doing and
    easily ask for help when you need to. Often you get serendipitous
    communication, where you overhear something that's really useful.</p><p>Hearing this, some people are concerned about noise, and would
    prefer private offices. In practice I find that teams don't find
    noise to be a serious issue. There's usually a hum of conversation
    going on, after all pair programming often accompanies this style
    of development. But the conversation isn't usually that
    distracting, particularly as you're focused on the conversation with
    your pair. I suspect the reason it's not that distracting is
    because the team has a common purpose around a collaborative
    activity. It isn't comparable to an open-plan office where
    everyone is doing something different.</p>
<h3>Tips for a good Team Room</h3>
<p>First make sure it is the right size for the team. While a team
    room should be open within itself, it should be closed to everyone
    else. In an ideal world you'd like flexible walls that can
    insulate one team from another, so an office consists of pods of
    teams. This is hard to do in practice. Our offices tend to be
    completely open, with little barriers between teams. This seems to
    work well-enough, although there are some complaints about the
    inter-team noise.</p><p>Pay attention to natural light. Humans are used to seeing the
    outside world, and all sorts of natural rhythms work off of
    light. So it's no surprise that people get very cranky if there
    isn't enough light about. I've spent plenty of days in enclosed
    conference rooms, and it certainly wears down my energy.</p><p>Provide enough space: about 50 square feet per person (4.5
    square meters for those on metric).</p><p>With the right kind of space the next key thing is to ensure
    that the team has control over that space. An important part of
    agile thinking is that the team is responsible for how it works,
    and how it organizes its space is part of that. Ideally you want a
    team to have complete control over their space, with freedom to
    configure it how they like and reconfigure it at will. Things
    should be done so it's easy to move things around, because during
    the project the team will need to change things as the project
    changes.</p>
<div class = 'photo' style = 'width: 400px'><img height = '290px' src = 'images/teamRoom/desk.jpg' width = '400px'></img>
<p>The purpose-built tables in our Beijing office have
    handy baskets for power and other cables.</p>
</div>
<p>An immediate consequence of this is to ditch any kind of
    modular furniture that requires a facilities group to move more than
    an inch. Most teams I see use simple tables, and you can certainly
    go cheap here.</p><p>The biggest hassle is wires - primarily for power and network
    access. Ideally you want these underfloor or overhead so that
    people can easily route wires to the tables, wherever the tables
    happen to be.</p><p>The place to spend money on furniture is for good quality
    chairs. Programmers spend a lot of time sitting, and any physical
    damage due to poor posture will have a direct effect on the team's
    productivity - so don't stint here. It may be that some people
    will want strange chairs, such as balls or kneeling chairs. Do
    your best to accommodate them.</p><p>Some people are big fans of tables that can be adjusted between
    a sitting and standing height, as they find that standing for a
    while helps with back pain. These are harder to find, but worth
    looking into if your team members need it. Back pain is a common
    issue, but everyone's pain (and treatment) is different.</p><p>You'll need lots of wall space, as agilists love their <a href = 'http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator'>information
    radiators</a>. You want plenty of room for story walls,
    architectural diagrams, whatever people want to stick on the
    wall. A good bit of this wall space should be whiteboards so
    people can draw something whenever the mood takes them. Include
    some wheeled whiteboards. Make sure there's a digital camera
    around so people can easily record what's on the board. Now that
    displays are so cheap, consider getting some just for wall
    displays - this is particularly handy for dynamic displays such as
    build status. I've seen one team have projectors trained on a wall
    with various kinds of information displays.</p><p>The traditional layout is to have people working around clumps
    of desks. This gives you regular eye contact with the rest of your
    team. However I've heard many people sing the praises of the
    <a href = 'UPod.html'>UPod</a>. </p><p>People will occasionally need some private space, so ensure
    there are one or two small conference rooms available, with
    telephones. These can be used for privacy or when there's a
    concern about distraction. A large meeting room that the team can
    gather in for meetings away from the working space is also
    handy. </p><p>I've always been a big proponent of lots of monitor
    space. Clever software with multiple virtual workspaces is a great
    feature, but nothing is faster than just moving your eyes. Every
    workstation should have a couple of 20 inch monitors as a bare
    minimum. My desk has a pair of 20 inch monitors for my Ubuntu
    machine and a 25 inch for my mac laptop. I don't think that's at
    all excessive.</p><p>Software development is inherently creative, so expect to see
    lots of baubly distractions. Toys are commonly found around our
    teams (as Neal Ford says: "every team needs a plastic
    kangaroo"). There are good cognitive reasons why this is valuable,
    it's all about keeping the brain stimulated and creative.</p><p>Similarly do provide easy access to snacks and drinks. This
    helps support informal, conversational breaks in the team
    area. It's hard to be creative when you have to pay for awful
    coffee.</p><p>If you're working with remote workers, make it easy to set up a
    video link. Indeed many teams like having permanent video links to
    any remote workers so you can always maintain that casual video
    contact.</p>
