<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction and Motivation<br>
</h2>
This Mini-HOWTO is aimed at people who have a laptop running linux, and
want to use it to give presentations via a computer screen projector
using free software, rather than use proprietary tools such as
powerpoint.<br>
<br>
When I first wrote this HOWTO, I had very little experience presenting
slides (though since then I've gotten quite a bit).
I wrote it partly
because I needed to research the options for an upcoming talk of my own,
and partly because I was tired of seeing presenters at linux and open
source gatherings using powerpoint because they didn't know there were
other options or didn't have time to research them. Besides,
powerpoint is <a
 href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/comment/story/0%2c12449%2c891336%2c00.html">"the
most loathsome, vicious and immoral piece of software ever produced"</a>
:-)&nbsp; If you doubt this, check out <a

<h2><a name="software"></a>Software for Creating and Presenting Slides</h2>
<p>
There are plenty of software packages which can do a good job of
presenting slides.
<p>
There are three major categories:
<p>
<b>Dedicated presentation programs</b>
are programs designed to present slides. They usually have their
own language for describing slides, and some of them include editing
tools to help you design and edit your slides. The main advantage of
this approach are that you're using a tool designed for the job.
<p>
<b>Browser/HTML based solutions</b> use HTML as the language for
describing slides. To display them, you use a web browser, such as
Firefox, usually in fullscreen mode. You can write the HTML by hand,
use an HTML editor, or use a special tool aimed at creating HTML
presentations. Advantages of this approach include portability,
flexibility and ease of showing your slides on the web, and you
can do equations with some difficulty (using <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/">MathML</a>).
Disadvantages mainly involve difficulties in styling HTML,
and browser portability issues.
The author prefers HTML for her own presentations; there are some
<a href="#moztips">tips for HTML presentations</a> later in this
document.
<p>
<b>PDF based solutions</b> use PDF as the slide language.
Most people who use PDF slides seem to use acroread as their
presentation tool, but evince and others also work.
Advantage: it's portable, and in a pinch you can always find
a machine that can display PDF at least to some extent.
Disadvantage: neither the viewers nor the creation tools
are usually very flexible, and multimedia (like animations
or effects) aren't an option.

<h3><a name="moztips"></a>Tips and Tools for HTML Presentations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You can write a lightlight HTML fullscreen presentation
  program in about 40 lines of Python: for example, see my
  <a href="http://shallowsky.com/software/scripts/preso">webkit preso</a>
  program.
  <li>Firefox has a <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.1b/">fullscreen mode</a>:
press F11 to toggle in and out.&nbsp; You still need to maximize the
window; and you'll still see a titlebar and your windowmanager's panel,
if any. You can turn them off with <i>View-&gt;Toolbars-&gt;Navigation
Controls</i></li>
  <li>Make a separate mozilla profile to use for giving presentations,
so you can hide the urlbar and so forth without affecting your normal
mozilla environment. Then you can add an entry to your panel or
menu system to call: <span style="font-style: italic;">mozilla -P
presenter</span> (subtitute your profile name).</li>
  <li>Alternately, you can make the urlbar disappear automatically
when you switch to fullscreen mode with this addition to <i>user.js</i>:
<p>
In Firefox:
<pre wrap>
#toolbar-menubar[moz-collapsed=true] + #nav-bar { display: none !important; }
</pre>
<p>
In Seamonkey:
<pre wrap>
#main-menubar[moz-collapsed=true] + #nav-bar { display: none !important; }
</pre>
  <li>Some ways to advance to the next slide with a one-key command:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Easy way (requires no fancy html or javascript): go through all
the pages in order before the presentation, then go back to the first
one and use alt-rightarrow to advance.<br>
    </li>
    <li>CSS to make your presentation all one document, one slide per
page (then use spacebar and page up/down keys to move around).&nbsp;
Disadvantage: shows a scrollbar.</li>
    <li>Use page accesskeys and light javascript, then you can move
around with keys like alt-N and alt-P, as in this <a
 href="http://www.gerv.net/presentations/fosdem2003/slide00.html">Bugzilla
Fosdem talk by Gervase Markham</a>.&nbsp; Note, this may not work well
if you <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#keys">rebind
your mozilla accel key</a>.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Use heavier javascript, so you can trap keys like spacebar,
forward and back arrows, and page up/down. You can do this with your
slides all in separate HTML files, like in
<a href="http://shallowsky.com/software/presentation/">this
example by the author</a>;
or you can put them all in one big file, as with this <a
 href="http://eu.mozdev.org/Brussels2003/talks/chregu/index.html">Bitflux
 Fosdem Talk</a> or with <a
 href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">Meyer Web's S5</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>If you're dying for effects like bullets scrolling in from the
side, that's easily done with Javascript.&nbsp; More complicated
animations are probably best done in mng or animated gif (create with <a
 href="http://www.gimp.org">gimp</a>, <a
 href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">image magick</a> or <a
 href="http://www.lcdf.org/%7Eeddietwo/gifsicle/">gifsicle</a>).&nbsp;
There are supposedly <a href="http://openswf.org/">free flash creation
tools</a>, but I've never figured them out myself.</li>
  <li>A useful collection of slides from presentations using mozilla
can be found at the <a href="http://eu.mozdev.org/Brussels2003/talks/">eu.mozdev.org
fosdem site</a>.<br>

<h3><a name="pdftips"></a>Tips and Tools for PDF presentations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>LaTeX has tools for producing slides, such as
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-beamer/">LaTeX Beamer</a>.
  LaTeX can be converted to
PS,&nbsp; PDF or HTML.
See this <a
 href="http://www.theorie.physik.uni-wuppertal.de/%7Erainer/talks/latex2pdf.html">latex2pdf</a>
page for some suggestions, and here's a <a
 href="http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/%7Eeddie/soft/tutorial.html">tutorial
for making slides in latex</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You can produce PDF slides with packages such as <a
 href="http://www.tug.org/applications/Seminar/">Seminar</a>, <a
 href="http://prosper.sourceforge.net/">Prosper</a>, <a
 href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/tex/foiltex.html">foiltex</a>,
or <a href="http://nwalsh.com/tex/texhelp/SliTeX.html">SliTeX</a>, or
using XML combined with a system like <a

<h2><a name="projector"></a>The Moment of Truth: Connecting to the
Projector<br>
</h2>
Here's a nice <a
 href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/%7Eteuben/linux/laptop-display.html">howto
on configuring X for connecting to projectors</a>.&nbsp; Some
additional tips I've found:
<p>
If you use an <i>xorg.conf</i> file, include some common lower
resolutions like add 800x600 and 640x480.
Then use ctl-alt-KeypadPlus and Minus to cycle through resolutions "live".
<p>
ctl-alt-KeypadPlus and Minus may not work in all xorg setups.
In newer Xorgs with some graphics cards, especially Intel, use
xrandr to control resolution and send the signal to the projector.
This command works on my current laptop:
<pre>
xrandr --output VGA --mode 1024x768
</pre>
When I'm done and no longer want to send to the projector, I run:
<pre>
xrandr --auto
</pre>
<p>
However, this doesn't always work either. Some projectors are picky
about whether the machine is sending a signal already when it's
plugged in, or whether it sees a signal during power up. If you
don't get a signal at first, keep trying. On my Vaio I find it's
sometimes helpful to run the xrandr command mentioned above, then
suspend the laptop and un-suspend it while still connected to the
projector.
<p>
Some projectors, especially older ones, require a strong signal and
won't work with a laptop that's displaying both to the external video
port and to its own LCD.&nbsp; This can be a problem on laptops (such as my
older Vaio) where the display is software controlled and there's no Linux
tool to switch to external-only mode.&nbsp; I haven't found a solution,
besides complaining to the laptop manufacturer and using a newer
projector.
<p>
Some machines, especially older ones like my first Vaio, have no
software-controlled way of switching the external signal on and off.
Instead, the BIOS turns on an external signal if it sees an external
monitor or projector plugged in at boot time. So if all else fails,
try rebooting with the projector connected. With this sort of
laptop, I recommend booting at home with a monitor connected,
suspending, then leaving the machine suspended until you get to the talk.
<p>
Try adding this option in the device section of the xorg.conf file: <br>
<pre>
    Option "Display" "BIOS"
</pre>
On some laptops, such as Dell, that enables the function key that
switches between LCD and CRT, and also allows the docking station to
detect the external monitor and automatically switch to CRT mode.
 <i>(Thanks to Justin Gaither.)</i>
<br>
nVidia-powered laptops have something called TwinView, which provide
full support for switching between displays.&nbsp; Check the nVidia
README.txt, "APPENDIX I: CONFIGURING TWINVIEW", for lots of
detail.&nbsp; Here's a pointer to <a
 href="http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86_40/1.0-2880/README.txt">nVidia's
XFree86 4.0 page</a>.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">(Thanks
to Jos Thalen for the nVidia information.)</span><br>
<br>
I'm sure there are other tricks for other laptops and distros.&nbsp;
This is an important section, so please help me out if you have
something to add here!<br>
<br>
Of course, always show up as early as possible in case there are
problems hooking up. (This applies no matter what OS you're running!
Windows and Mac users have just as much difficulty connecting to
projectors as Linux users do.)

<h2><a name="remote"></a>Remote Presenter Devices</h2>
What about those remote presenter gizmos where you can press buttons
to advance a slide while pacing back and forth on the other side of
the room from your PC?
<p>
No problem. Most of them are implemented as generic USB keyboard
devices and will work just fine with Linux.
I have a Logitech Cordless Presenter and love it (battery life is
amazing, too).
<p>
Be aware that presenters
don't all send the same key sequences: some send Page Up/Down, some
send up/down arrow, some apparently look like a mouse and send
right/left mouse clicks. So you may need to check your presentation
tool: if you're using PDF or scroll-down CSS, you may want to look
for one which sends Page Up/Down. If you're using OpenOffice, it
probably follows the normal PowerPoint conventions and will work
with most tools. If you're using HTML and JavaScript, then you can
use anything as long as you make sure your JS obeys the right keys.

<h2><a name="sharing">A Note on Sharing Slides</h2>
<p>
Your choice of slide format may affect how easy it is to share your
slides with the world.
<p>
HTML slides are easy to put on a website so they're accessible to
anyone. Be aware, though, that sites like Slideshare won't accept
HTML, so you might lose out on any social-networking benefit from Slideshare.
<p>
Just about everyone can read PDF slides, so you can put those on the
web and let people download the presentation. They have to download
the whole thing, though; you can't just point to one slide.
<p>
OpenOffice can save in PowerPoint format, but it will lose
animations and may lose formatting and transition effects.
Powerpoint isn't as ubiquitous as some people seem to think: not
all Windows users have Powerpoint (it doesn't come free with
Windows) so it's really not a great format for sharing.
It's usually the only format accepted by non open-source
conferences, though.
<p>
Open-source conferences usually specify that your slides should be
ODP (OpenOffice's native format). You can freely ignore this and give them
a PDF or a tarball of HTML slides; when they say ODP they really mean
"an open format, not Powerpoint" and they haven't considered the
possibility that anyone would use something besides OpenOffice.
<p>
Special formats used by programs like KPresenter or MagicPoint,
while open, will be hard for most people to display and aren't a
great choice for sharing.

<h2><a name="conclusions"></a>Some Conclusions (warning, personal opinion)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For my own presentations, I prefer using HTML and Firefox.
I already have the tools, I already know html, and I like being able to put
the presentation on the web without doing any extra work.</li>
  <li>People used to powerpoint and gui tools might be happiest with
KPresenter -- the UI is a bit rough but it is flexible and wysiwyg</li>
  <li>People who already work with latex and pdf will probably prefer
that format for presentations.</li>
  <li>People who need to be compatible with powerpoint (perhaps because
it's required at the company or conference where the presentation will be made,
because they can use the standard company templates, or when writing a
presentation for a windows user) will probably prefer Open Office,
but stay away from fancy effects.</li>
