<h3>xUnit Test Patterns - the book
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The book has won a Jolt Productivity Award in the Best Technical 
						Book category! Here's what the reviewer Rick Wayne said about 
						why the book won the award:
</p><p class='quote'>Unit testing is hardly news, but simply 
							writing a ton of tests guarantees you no bliss. Gerard Meszaros's 
							xUnit Test Patterns distills and codifies the crucial meta-knowledge 
							to take us to the next level. Why do good tests go bad, and how do 
							you fix them--it's as simple and groundbreaking as that. Smells and 
							antipatterns arise in tests that cripple their maintainability. 
							xUnit Test Patterns exhaustively describes those pathologies and 
							provides the prescription in the catalog format familiar since 1994. 
							But fear not - every motivation and pattern includes at least one 
							source-code example and the explanations are couched in clear, 
							direct language. If you're ready to promote your test code to the 
							same level of care and craftsmanship that you devote to production 
							systems, grab a copy of xUnit Test Patterns and get cracking.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Other reviewers have been equally kind:
</p><p class='quote'>
							Awesome book must have for any software developer &#45; A. B. Powell
							</p>
<p>
</p><p class='quote'>
							Our team has been doing TDD for 6 years since the seminal Kent Beck book.
							We as a team have learnt read and improved our practice over these years but this book has had the most impact on how 2 do TDD properly.
							It has significantly improved our code and our testing practices.
							Many of the leasons we learnt where emphasised and standardised in this book.
							All I can say is that you will save yourself years and years of hard knocks learning if you read this book first.
							By following the patterns in this book we have been more easily able to implement the principles in Kent's book.
							&#45;Brett

<h3>Contents Overview
</h3>
<p>The book is organized in 3 major parts. Part I consists of a series of 
			introductory narratives that describe some aspect of test automation using 
			<a href='xUnit.html' class='GlossaryRef'>xUnit</a>. This includes a list of Goals and Principles which are summarized on 
			the left size of this diagram:
</p><br/><img src='Goals-Smells.gif' style='margin:20px 20px 20px 20px;'></img><br/><span class='note'>Sketch Goals-Smells embedded from Goals-Smells.gif</span><br/>
<p>Part II describes a number of "test smells" that are symptoms of problems 
			with how we are automating our tests. These symptoms are summarized in the right 
			side of the previous diagram.
</p>
<p>Part III contains descriptions of the patterns. The chapters correspond to 
			the major boxes in the following diagram:
</p><br/><img src='Patterns Summary.gif' style='margin:20px 20px 20px 20px;'></img><br/><span class='note'>Sketch Patterns Summary embedded from Patterns Summary.gif</span><br/>
<p>The major boxes in each of the preceding diagrams corresponds to a chapter in 
			the corresponding part of the book; they also correspond the "categories" 
			listed in the top left navigation sidebar on this web site. Selecting a category 
			provides a list of patterns or smells in the category and selecting a specific 
			pattern or smell adds a list of aliases, causes and variations of the chosen 
			pattern or smell.
</p>
<p>The following diagram summarizes the notation used in these overview 
			diagrams:
</p><br/><img src='Visual Summary Legend.gif' style='margin:20px 20px 20px 20px;'></img><br/><span class='note'>Sketch Visual Summary Legend embedded from Visual Summary Legend.gif</span><br/>
<p>Of course, you can access the material in "book order" by starting in 
			<a href='Book Outline.html' class='Ref'>Book Outline</a>. Because so much has changed during the copy 
			editing process, I'll be "abridging" the material on this web site once the book 
			is out. I will, however, keep a brief summary of each pattern &amp; smell on 
			the site as well as many of the cross reference tables.
</p><a name='Why is Test Automation Important?'></a>
<h3>Why is Test Automation Important?
</h3>
<p>Automated <a href='unit test.html' class='GlossaryRef'>unit tests</a> (a.k.a. "<a href='developer test.html' class='GlossaryRef'>developer tests</a>") and 
			<a href='customer test.html' class='GlossaryRef'>customer tests</a> (a.k.a. "functional tests") are a cornerstone of 
			many agile development methods (such as eXtreme Programming). The availability 
			of automated, self-checking tests allows developers to be much bolder in how 
			they modify existing software. They allow a more evolutionary form of software 
			development that support incremental delivery of functionality to the customer 
			(motto: Deliver early; deliver often!) that speeds up user feedback and improves 
			the quality (both "fitness for purpose" and "software quality") of the software 
			being built. The techniques are also spreading to less agile development methods 
			via the introduction of "Test Driven Development" as a less extreme process 
			alternative.
</p>
<p>Automated test are more repeatable than manual tests because they execute 
			exactly the same way every time. They don't forget things after long weekends 
			and vacations. They don't leave to work on other projects. They don't get sick 
			or run over by a bus.
</p>
<p>Automated tests take a lot less effort to run than manual tests. As a result, 
			they are more likely to be run often. The more often the better. Fully 
			assimilated agile developers run their tests pretty well every time they save 
			and compile their code. And any time they need a quick vote of confidence! The 
			tests act as a comforting "safety net" that promises to catch the developer's 
			mistakes. This allows them to work more quickly and with less paranoia and that 
			makes them more productive despite the extra effort involved in writing the 
			tests.
</p><a name='Why is Test Automation Hard?'></a>
<h3>Why is Test Automation Hard?
</h3>
<p>Cost effective test automation is all about repeatability, maintainability 
			and communication. Repeatability of results requires repeatability of test 
			fixture setup and repeatability of the interactions with the software under 
			test. And that requires interfaces into the software under test that allow you 
			to put it in the right state before the test and to find out what state it is in 
			after the test. And that can be hard. Throw in the need to make the tests easy 
			to understand and easy to maintain and the problem gets even harder.
</p>
<p>Automating tests using XUnit is a form of software whether you write the 
			tests before or after the code it tests. But the goals of this test software 
			("testware") is very different from the software most people are used to 
			writing. Writing it is optional so we can stop writing it or maintaining it at 
			any time. So we need compelling reason to (keep) writing them. And there is a 
			lot to think about when automating tests. How do I interact with the SUT? What 
			is the best way to express the expected outcome? How can I keep tests from 
			breaking each other? How can I ensure the tests will work next week, next month, 
			even next year? How do I test when the software under test depends on software 
			that hasn't been written yet? Or cannot be used in our test environment? Or 
			makes the tests take too long to run? If writing the tests is hard and has 
			little benefit, we just won't do it any more!
</p><a name='Why Test Automation *Patterns*?'></a>
<h3>Why Test Automation *Patterns*?
</h3>
<p>I have been reading the various conference papers and (mostly JUnit-based) 
			books on test automation for quite some time. Each author seems to have a 
			particular area of interest and favorite techniques. While I don't always agree 
			with their practices, I am always trying to understand why they do it a 
			particular way and *when* it would be more appropriate to use their techniques 
			than the ones I already use.
</p>
<p>This is one of the major different between prose that merely explains a 
			technique and a pattern. Patterns help the reader understand the WHY behind each 
			practice so they can make intelligent choices between the alternative patterns 
			(and thereby avoid nasty consequences from surprising them later.)
</p>
<p>Some projects are using the XUnit tools to automate regression tests. All of 
			these initiatives are more successful when the test developers have experience 
			building tests. And the next best thing to having experience test automaters on 
			your project (which ClearStream Consulting would be more than happy to supply) 
			is a well-documented set of good test automation practices in the form of 
			patterns.
</p><a name='Background of this website'></a>
<h3>Background of this website
</h3>
<p>I've assembled this site to catalog the good practices in <a href='xUnit.html' class='GlossaryRef'>xUnit</a> test 
			automation I've encountered over the years. It came about as a result of 
			discussions between me (<a href='The Author.html' class='Ref'>Gerard Meszaros</a>) 
			and Shaun Smith about the testing techniques we found ourselves using over and 
			over again to solve particular <a href='xUnit.html' class='GlossaryRef'>xUnit</a> test automation problems.
</p>
<p>We started off by writing a paper <a href='Faster Tests.html' class='ReferencesRef'>[IEAT]</a> that we presented 
			at XP2001 in Sardinia, Italy on techniques that we had used to make our tests 
			run much faster. This led to discussions with the inventors of <a href='Mock Object.html' class='PatternRef'>Mock Objects</a><span class='first-file-ref'> (page X)</span> about whether we were using <a href='Mock Object.html' class='PatternRef'>Mock Objects</a> or 
			some other technique.
</p>
<p> We presented another paper <a href='TAM.html' class='ReferencesRef'>[TAM]</a> at XP/Agile Universe 2003 in New 
			Orleans, Louisiana in which we identified a number of smells and the principles 
			we used to avoid them. These built on papers presented in previous XP 
			conferences on the use of <a href='Mock Object.html' class='PatternRef'>Mock Objects</a> and testing of Frameworks. 
			Discussions with other TDD folk convinced us that there was a real need to share 
			and standardize the vocabulary around XUnit-based test automation. Naturally, 
			patterns were the obvious choice for communicating this knowledge.
</p>
<p>Since XP/Agile Universe 2003, we have been cataloging all the patterns we 
			regularly use and the obvious alternatives that we have consciously chosen not 
			to use. We have also been looking through the mostly JUnit-based books on test 
			automation to see what others are advocating looking for techniques whether or 
			not they are described as patterns. There is some obvious overlap between the 
			various material but also seem to be considerable gaps and no comprehensive 
			treatment of the topic. As of October 2003, we had identified over 120 patterns 
			ranging from principles and strategies to coding-level idioms!
</p><a name='Organization of this website'></a>
<h3>Organization of this website
</h3>
<p>I'll be keeping a brief summary of each pattern &amp; smell on the web site 
			once the book is out. The best place to start is with the <a href='Book Outline.html' class='Ref'>Book Outline</a> (or <a href='Book Outline Diagrams.html' class='Ref'>Book Outline Diagrams</a>).
</p>
<p>All the information on this website is organized into categories. The 
			categories are accessible via hyperlinks in the "All Categories" box on the left 
			side. Once a category is selected, the pages (patterns, narratives , etc.) 
			within the category can be accessed from the "All <i>categoryName</i>" box that 
			appears below the "All Categories" box.
</p>
<h4>The Narratives
</h4>
<p>All patterns, smells, etc. are first introduced in a series of narratives 
				that provide an overview of a particular topic area. The narratives are 
				accessible via the special category "Narratives" from the "All Categories" 
				box or from the <a href='Book Outline.html' class='Ref'>Book Outline</a>.
</p>
<h4>The Patterns and Smells
</h4>
<p>The patterns and smells are organized into "categories" that each 
				correspond to a single chapter in the book. The categories are accessible via 
				hyperlinks in the "All Categories" box on the left side. Once a category is 
				selected, the patterns within the category can be accessed from the "All 
				<i>categoryName</i>" box that appears below the "All Categories" box.
</p>
<p>The patterns and smells can also be accessed in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>via hyperlinks from within the narratives
</li>
<li>via hyperlinks from other patterns or smells
</li>
<li>from the "Category Contents" sidebar on many pages
</li>
</ul>
<p>The various categories can also be accessed from the <a href='Book Outline.html' class='Ref'>Book Outline</a>.
