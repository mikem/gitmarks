      <a name="article_body"></a>
       <p>Over three years ago, <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2005/4/10/text-editing-dilemma">I was faced with a dilemma</a>. I had recently switched to the Mac (from Linux) and was still using my text editor of choice (<a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>), but at the time, vim&#8217;s &#8220;integration&#8221; with <span class="caps">OS X</span> was pretty minimal (and that&#8217;s putting it optimistically). I experimented with emacs, but it never clicked for me, and honestly, emacs on <span class="caps">OS X</span> wasn&#8217;t all that better than vim at the time. Sadly, reluctantly, I said good-bye to vim and switched to <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a>.</p>


	<p>TextMate was (and certainly still is) a fantastic text editor. The project drawer was awesome, finding files via cmd-T was super powerful, and smarter auto-completion and snippets promised a new and faster way to pound code. After a couple of months of reteaching my fingers how to edit text, I was happy.</p>


	<p>Sometimes, though, late at night, I would think again of vim.</p>


	<p>Fast forward three years. The vim landscape is different now. There is actually a Mac-friendly <span class="caps">GUI</span> version of vim now, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim">MacVim</a>, which actually looks like it belongs on <span class="caps">OS X</span>. Vim 7 supports UI tabs, and a much more powerful auto-completion mechanism than before. And plugins like <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567">rails.vim</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984">fuzzyfinder.vim</a> mean that TextMate no longer has a corner on powerful project navigation.</p>


	<p>For the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been toying with switching back to vim. TextMate&#8217;s &#8220;snippet&#8221; feature never clicked for me, and the only times I used it were by accident (when it annoyed me more than it helped me), but I really was hooked on the project browser, and cmd-T, and a few other things. I realized that, with a little work, perhaps a way could be found to reimplement most of the things I loved about TextMate, in vim.</p>


	<p>This last week I&#8217;ve worked exclusively in vim, to test that theory. It&#8217;s like coming home. As I said, TextMate is a powerful and wonderful editor, too, but <em>differently</em> powerful and wonderful. Vim&#8217;s wonderfulness and power is the wonderfulness and power of git, or linux, where the learning curve is steep (ridiculously steep at times), but the rewards of mastery are sublime. I didn&#8217;t even realize I had missed a sane shift-J, or using the dot key to repeat the last command. Fix transposition typos with &#8216;xp&#8217;. Select a single word with &#8216;viw&#8217;. Drop bookmarks with &#8216;m&#8217;, and jump right back to them with single quote.</p>


	<p>If any of that makes your stomach roil, then vim is not for you. :) But to me, it&#8217;s like being embraced by a long-lost friend after years apart. And vim holds no grudges.</p>


	<p>There was still the issue of the TextMate features that I had particularly come to love. First to tackle was cmd-T, since my workflow had become so dependent on that for finding files. Takeshi <span class="caps">NISHIDA</span>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984">fuzzyfinder.vim</a> script seemed like exactly what I wanted&#8230;at first. It&#8217;s definitely a powerful tool, but the fuzzy finder for files was not TextMate&#8217;s cmd-T, and my instinctive attempts to treat it so were causing me a lot of aggravation.</p>


	<p>So I took an evening and wrote <a href="http://github.com/jamis/fuzzy_file_finder/tree/master">fuzzy_file_finder</a>, a Ruby library that mimics (and improves on, if I do say so myself) TextMate&#8217;s cmd-T functionality. Then, I extended fuzzyfinder.vim with <a href="http://github.com/jamis/fuzzyfinder_textmate/tree/master">fuzzyfinder_textmate</a>, which bound the fuzzy_file_finder to vim. The result?</p>


	<p>See for yourself: <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/buckblog/videos/fuzzyfinder_textmate.mov">http://s3.amazonaws.com/buckblog/videos/fuzzyfinder_textmate.mov</a> (600K, QuickTime video).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m still working on a solution for the project browser. Yes, I know there are several (&#8220;countless&#8221; might be a more accurate term) vim plugins that present a project drawer in a split window, but even before being spoiled by TextMate those didn&#8217;t feel right to me. I&#8217;m experimenting with a cocoa tree view that sends files to a specific vim server, and it mostly works, but I&#8217;m still not sure it&#8217;s the right solution. If I do come up with something, I&#8217;ll definitely open it up and share it. (On the other hand, if any of you out there in readerland already know of such a thing, please point me at it!)</p>


	<p>So, I&#8217;m still reacquaiting myself with all my old muscle memories, but here are some commands I wasn&#8217;t previously very familiar with which are proving useful in conquering my TextMate habits:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>:e [file]. This is great if you don&#8217;t want to use fuzzy finding. Vim will even do tab completion to make things easier.</li>
		<li>:ls. Shows all of your buffers.</li>
		<li>:buffer [file]. Fantastic for quickly switching between buffers. You can give it just part of a file name and it will jump to the buffer that matches.</li>
		<li>The ctrl-6 (technically ctrl-caret) key is awesome for switching back and forth between two buffers. For instance, if I just need to quickly look at one buffer, I can jump right back to where I was with ctrl-caret.</li>
		<li>ctrl-W introduces a whole host of options for working with split windows.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>And lastly, can I just say that Vim is seriously the poster-child for documentation? I recommend spending 15-30 minutes, every day, in :help, just exploring. There is a <span class="caps">LOT</span> there, and all excellently documented.</p>


	<p>So, all you vimsters out there: what commands do <em>you</em> frequently use? What features of vim are you so dependent on that you&#8217;d be useless without them? Do share!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Jamis,</p>


	<p>This is super-rocking.  Way to go!</p>


	<p>I use textile.vim like crazy:</p>


	<p>http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2305</p>


	<p>I also use surround.vim, taglist.vim, bufexplorer.vim, and fuzzyfinder.vim.</p>


	<p>I keep gravitating between TextMate and <span class="caps">VIM</span>.  I&#8217;ve landed, for now, at using TextMate for everything rails, and <span class="caps">VIM</span> for everything else.  The bundles in TextMate are hard to beat, and I&#8217;ve been able to use macros to overcome some TextMate pain felt by learning (and loving) <span class="caps">VIM</span>.</p></div>

	<p>I had been playing with Vim before that and was in love with how quickly I could move around in a file.  Buffer Explorer and  Surround (mentioned in another comment) make my Vim life complete.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t miss the snippets.  I found them to be a crutch and they were inhibiting my knowledge of a language or <span class="caps">API</span>.  I spent more time trying to remember triggers than the <span class="caps">API</span> itself.</p></div>

&#8220;Sane Shift-J&#8221; exists in TM as  control+shift+j; you can transpose characters with simple ctrl+t; select one word with alt+shift+arrow (there is a bunch of nice standard keyboard shortcuts in <span class="caps">OS X</span> too).</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>@Rimantas, please, this post was not an attack on TM users. I explored TM plenty deep. I know about control-shift-J, and to me, it is not sane. Every time I used it I had to insert a space&#8212;vim is smart enough to do that for you. And I know about alt-shift-arrow, etc.</p>


	<p>If that all works for you, that&#8217;s great! Stay with TextMate. I&#8217;m definitely not suggesting everybody move to vim. But for me, I love vim. I always have. TM was a stopgap for me until vim&#8217;s <span class="caps">OS X</span> presence improved.</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>My favorite vim command is definitely :s. Nothing beats vim for easy replace:</p>


	<p>:%s/typo/correction/g</p>


	<p>and you can use &#38; to repeat the last substitution.</p>


	<p>Other highlights:</p>


	<p>Ctrl-] to jump to a tag, and Ctrl-T to jump back.  Try the rails.vim :Rtags command for dead simple taglists!</p>


	<p>do and dp for getting and putting changes in diff mode.  Who needs a fancy merge tool?</p>


	<p>surround.vim.  Awesome stuff:
ysiwttag&gt; : wrap the current word with &lt;tag>&lt;/tag>
cs&#8217;&#8221; : change surrounding &#8217; to &#8221; 
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697</p>


	<p>rails.vim.  Priceless!  The smart gf alone is worth it.
http://rails.vim.tpope.net/</p>


allml.vim.  Great for editing rhtml. And if you have surround.vim, it adds the rhtml tags as surround types!
&lt;insert>Ctrl-= : wrap cursor in &lt;%=  %&gt;
&lt;insert>Ctrl&#8212;: wrap cursor in &lt;%  -%&gt;
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1896

          <div class="body"><p>I know how it feels to &#8220;come home to Vim.&#8221; I&#8217;ve done it several times, and I always get that warm, wonderful feeling. Vim is where it&#8217;s at; it&#8217;s like some archetype of the programming experience that&#8217;s unique unto itself.</p>


	<p>Anyway :-)  I started using other editors because I found it hard to navigate classes that had a ton of functions (I essentially had to just scroll around, or do a &#8221;/&#8221;-find). Then one day, after missing Vim sufficiently, I was trying to find solutions online, and I ran across the <a href="http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/">taglist plugin</a>.</p>


	<p>Taglist will identify classes, functions, and variables, and display them in a vertical window to the side of your main editing environment. After binding &lt;f4> to turn taglist on, and &lt;f5> to refresh it, I&#8217;m in paradise.</p>


	<p>I haven&#8217;t really been looking for a solution to TextMate&#8217;s project file viewer. Instead, I just leave a Windows Explorer window open, and open all my files in separate Vim instances. It works out beautifully.</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>Here&#8217;s something that regularly sends me into a killin&#8217; rage.  Iwork with a big application. It&#8217;s not uncommon for a gvim session to have 100 or more buffers open.</p>


	<p>Now lets say I sit down to work on a bug. I surf around through my buffers, figuring out what needs to be fixed.  Not often, but sometimes, I&#8217;ll accidentally modify a buffer when the file hasn&#8217;t yet been checked out of perforce.</p>


	<p>After a few minutes of fixing stuff, I click the F8 key, which is mapped to a command to do a :wa and run a build.  However, that modified buffer can&#8217;t be written because I didn&#8217;t check the file out. So what does gvim do?  It tells me that it can&#8217;t write the file, but it <span class="caps">DOESN</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">TELL ME WHICH FUCKING FILE IT IS</span>.  I have to do a :buffers and try to remember what the cryptic little markers mean in order to find the buffer.  Please, <span class="caps">PLEASE</span> make the error message better.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s another one: I sync from the source code repository. Then I go back to my gvim window. Oh, look!  50 of the files in open buffers have been updated!  Guess how many popups I get to deal with? 50!  <span class="caps">I HAVE TO CLICK</span> &#8220;OK&#8221; 50 <span class="caps">TIMES</span>!!  For christs sake just give me a &#8220;do this for all updated files&#8221; option.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been using vi since about 1983, so I&#8217;m definitely a fan otherwise.</p></div>

	<p>I wrote a shell script one time which grepped all my rails files for some name or searched their file names, then created a bunch of sym links in a tmp directory which I then opened in vim.

But I&#8217;ve been using netbeans and its jvi plugin at the moment.</p>


	<p>Occasionally also use in-built tabbing of vim (as opposed to split or vsplit): &#8221;:tabnew .&#8221;  will open a tab of the current directory etc</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re in a directory in vim, use &#8217;-&#8217; to go up to the parent dir; &#8216;o&#8217; to open a subdir or file in split window, or just plain &lt;return>.</p></div>

	<p>lookupfile.vim : plugin to find files easily. seems to do something similar to your fuzzyfile thing; I am going to check out your one tomorrow to see what the differences are.</p>


	<p>ctags : I don&#8217;t actually use this for tags, I use cscope, above, for that. Instead I use ctags and some sed/awk magic to generate a custom syntax file which highlights my own definitions and types and stuff.</p>

It&#8217;s very young and fundamentally less powerful than Vim or Emacs and the only features that I really like are the ones people add-on with Bundles that have limited control.</p>


	<p>Then I decided to just go for it and learn Emacs, and it&#8217;s been a very good decision and I&#8217;ll never go back. It&#8217;s literally the most extensible software ever made and very enjoyable with it&#8217;s Lisp dialect; Emacs-Lisp.</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>Interesting post &#8230; and good info in the comments too.</p>


	<p>Yes, vim is great &#8211; and as others said, it has a huge number of commands and pretty good documentation.</p>


	<p>@Jamis:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Drop bookmarks with ‘m’, and jump right back to them with single quote.</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>You might know this already, but, if instead of single quote, you use the backquote key to go back to your mark, the cursor goes back to the exact cursor position you were at when you marked the line with the m command, not just to the beginning of that line (as it does with single quote).</p>


	<p>One of my favorite vim commands, and a powerful one, is this:</p>


	<p>If you prefix most vim commands that would move the cursor (through some part of the file) with an exclamation mark (!), and suffix the movement command with a call to an external shell command, like sort, ls, etc, vim pipes the range of text (that would have been moved through) to that shell command, and then <strong>replaces</strong> that text (in the file) with the output of that command. The command should be a filter (a command that reads standard input and writes to standard output). This also worked in vi.</p>


	<p>Example:</p>


	<p>Take this simple file, called a, created by redirecting the output of the ls command while in some directory (I&#8217;ve deleted the filenames at the end of each line, as they are not relevant, and also the &#8220;total&#8221; line that ls adds at the top):</p>


<pre>
  --------- Contents of file a --------------------
  -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   0 2008-10-11 15:18

  -------------------------------------------------
</pre>

	<p>I opened it in vi, then gave this command:</p>


	<p>!Gsort -n -k 5</p>


	<p>Then saved the file as file b:</p>


<pre>
  --------- Contents of file b --------------------
  -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   0 2008-10-11 15:18 
  srwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   0 2008-10-11 11:21

  drwx------ 3 ubuntu ubuntu  60 2008-10-11 11:21 
  drwx------ 2 ubuntu ubuntu 580 2008-10-11 11:44 
  -------------------------------------------------
</pre>

	<p>The lines in the file are now sorted by file sizes.</p>


	<p>The command sort -n -k 5 sorts whatever is in its standard input, in numerical order (-n), using the 5th column or field (space-separated  fields are the default) as the key to sort on (-k 5). Since the G command moves to the end of the file being edited, and I was on the first line when I gave the overall command, the full command results in the entire file being sorted by the file sizes (the 5th field of ls output), and that sorted output replaces the contents of the entire file. By just changing the column number (and dropping the -n if you want alphabetical sorting), you can also sort by number of links, modification date,  file name, file owner, etc. Of course, this technique works on any text file, including program code, program input data, etc., not just on ls listings.</p>


	<p>Instead of sort, you can use uniq, awk, sed, tr or any other standard Linux/UNIX filter. Or any one that you wrote.</p>

Although I have a problem when I use an &#8216;autocmd&#8217; to keep the working path to the file being edited&#8230; For example, with the following structure:</p>


	<p>project/file1.c
project/tests/in1</p>


	<p>If my path is project/ and I use the plugin to edit project/tests/in1, the next time I use it to navigate to file1.c it tries to edit a &#8220;new&#8221; file in project/tests/.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@Joe, cmd-T is similar to :sfind, except it lets you match loosely on the pattern you enter. With sfind, for instance, the characters you enter must be exactly adjacent to one another in the file name. With cmd-T, they simply need to exist in the file name, in order, but not necessarily adjacent.</p>


	<p>Also, cmd-T gives you real-time autocompletion of the files that match the pattern, as you type, which feels less like guesswork than sfind (and friends).</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>Anyone have a good suggestion for comment #85 concerning find in all files? The :grep command automatically opens the first file and you can only edit other files by typing in the number found in :clist. It would be better if it was like fuzzyfinder where you just scroll down to the file you want and start editing by pressing enter.</p>


	<p>Also, I found a bug in fuzzyfinder_textmate where if you run FuzzyFinderTextMate in one directory then cd into another directory, FuzzyFinderTextMate still only searches among the files in the previous directory.</p>


	<p>+1 vote for comment #34 where the pattern matches should be colorized instead of parenthesized.</p>

	<p>Not only that, the Macvim <strong>developer</strong> is awesome. He single handedly improved my Mac programming productivity about 50%.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m a blind programmer. Originally I ran on Linux in, believe it or not, Emacs. Then I switched to the Mac. But do you think I could find a decent editor? BBedit? No. It won&#8217;t work with the accessibility stuff for <span class="caps">OS X</span> and the author claimed to have no intention of it ever doing so. Textmate? No. Same problem, and the author said it was incredibly hard and he didn&#8217;t know if he&#8217;d ever do it. Emacs? No. same problem <strong>again</strong>. So I languished. I used Smultron. I used subethaedit. I hacked and struggled with applescript and tiny shell scripts and Quicksilver to get basic editors to be even slightly adequate. I even had to give up programming in python altogether due to the lack of really good indent and navigation support.</p>


	<p>Admittedly that wasn&#8217;t all bad, it let me find Ruby, but still, that hurt. But then I found Macvim. At first it didn&#8217;t work, no cursor tracking, but one query on the Macvim list and a patch, and it worked brilliantly. And I love it. And I&#8217;m going to be committing heresy, but Vim fits my brain better than Emacs ever did. Talk about coming home to an editor.</p></div>

	<p>One of the things that annoyed me about TextMate&#8217;s cmd-T, and of course exacerbated by RESTful Rails projects, was the inability to filter the path as well as the file name. I usually have a lot of index files, sometimes under multiple namespaces, and the ability to slap in say &#8220;a/j/i&#8221; to drill to admin/jobs/index is a godsend.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t have too many views outside of the typical <span class="caps">REST</span> action collection, so abbrebiated controller paths + first letter of action is a much more attractive proposition than scrolling down lists of index files in TextMate.</p>

	<p>Only issue I&#8217;m having is trying to alternate different g:fuzzy_roots
- I can let and unlet g:fuzzy_roots, but FuzzyFinderTextMate seems to only search what every directory tree&#8217;s were in g:fuzzy_roots when it was initially loaded.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve tried 
  :ruby finder.rescan!
but that didn&#8217;t seem to make any difference.
Any ideas?</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>@Dave, the fuzzy_roots are set when the finder is instantiated, and once instantiated, the instance is cached. You can force it to be reinstantiated by doing something like this:</p>


<pre>:ruby @finder = nil</pre>

	<p>And then running the fuzzy finder again.</p></div>

	<p>I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;ve already looked at Project? (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69), but I&#8217;ve been using that for a while, and find it pretty handy.</p>


	<p>Instead of just browsing fs directories, you set up the specific files in the project you&#8217;re interested in, and you can set it to run arbitrary scripts when you enter/exit a working directory.
This lets it integrate very well with FuzzyFinderTextMate &#8211; I&#8217;ve created an &#8220;in.vim&#8221; for each project that looks something like:</p>


<code>
  let code='/home/dgs/code/uwh/'
  let g:fuzzy_roots=[code."app", code."config"] 
  ruby @finder = nil
</code>

	<p>Which will automatically flip it to the new fuzzy_roots dependent on what files you&#8217;re currently working on. Very handy =)</p></div>

I spent quite a while trying to get it working, and it turns out that there aren&#8217;t any real options for colorizing specific parts of the text in that autocompletion popup menu.  More info here: http://vim.dindinx.net/vim7/html/insert.txt.php#popupmenu-keys</p>


	<p>For fun, I asked around in #vim, and got the same answer.  I tried even tried using the terminal escape codes for colors, even though that would be a pretty poor solution, and those get ignored when the menu is generated.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@jamis:  Thanks for the post.  It echos much of my same feelings re: Textmate and Vim for <span class="caps">OSX</span> peeps.</p>


	<p>http://www.martini.nu/blog/2008/07/vim.html</p>


	<p>One of my standby tricks when dedicating a vim session to a particular project is to always do a &#8220;set path=**&#8221; and :chdir to the project&#8217;s location.</p>


	<p>Then, I rarely (if ever) use the regular :e and :sp commands for opening buffers, instead using :find and :sf, which search against the path variable.  Very handy.</p>


	<p>Where this falls short is when you&#8217;ve got two files with the same name&#8212;:find only gives you the first.  I&#8217;ll definitely be checking out your plugin to get around this (I&#8217;m using the regular fuzzyFinder at the moment.)</p>


	<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;ll pimp two other creations&#8230;  ;)</p>


	<p>A different RSpec integration with Vim (that capitalized on what I describe above):
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2286</p>


	<p>Automated Vim plugin builds using Vimball+Make:
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_VimBall_with_%27Make%27</p>


	<p>The last thing I&#8217;m looking for that I feel would really make things &#8220;complete&#8221;&#8212;is a &#8220;find in project&#8221; for Vim.  I can&#8217;t seem to find one that allows cherry-picking files to apply the search/replace to.  :vimgrep is close, but no easy &#8220;multi-select and apply.&#8221;  If anyone here knows of something that replicates that sweet shift-cmd-F action&#8230; holler at me.  :)</p></div>

	<p>1.  I use Vim, as it is portable.  Jump into any machine, and you&#8217;re good to go.  Getting comfortable with a specific machines <span class="caps">GUI</span> version of the program seems odd.</p>


	<p>2.  Any programmatic sequences that you could set in MacVim could be done in Vim, albeit, probably not as easy I&#8217;m assuming.  But&#8230; if Vim is your primary editor, it is a good idea to be familiar with it&#8217;s configuration and customization options.</p>


	<p>3.  Vim works fine on <span class="caps">OSX</span>.  Why use something else ?  anti-aliasing ?</p>


	<p>Any feedback that could possibly point a Vim purist in another direction would be appreciated ;)</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>@D, MacVim works exactly like Vim, as you said. If I &#8220;get comfortable&#8221; with macvim, I&#8217;m not digging myself into any holes, as I&#8217;ll be using the same key bindings and same config options via any command-line vim.</p>


	<p>The benefit of a <span class="caps">GUI</span> version, as I see it, is the ability to differentiate multiple open vim windows from my multiple open console windows. If I only use console windows, then everything looks like a console window, both in the alt-tab switcher, and in the dock. Using a <span class="caps">GUI</span>, MacVim has it&#8217;s own icon.</p>


	<p>Then again, if you&#8217;ve not felt this particular pain, then you&#8217;re definitely not the target audience for MacVim. Don&#8217;t go lording it over us lesser vim users, though. Let&#8217;s just agree that different people have different preferred development environments.</p></div>

          <div class="body"><p>This is a really cool idea! It&#8217;s not a function I really used in TextMate because the drawer was excellent, but I&#8217;ve not been able to find something so versatile for Vim. However, as ek says, this doesn&#8217;t work with the latest version of fuzzyfinder.vim (2.16).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m a relative beginner to Vim. I&#8217;m primarily a web developer and I do a lot of my work over secure shell connections. This obviously means that TextMate doesn&#8217;t play (without great pain on my part), so I took to installing Vim and having a play around. Needless to say, it blew nano out of the water and after having played with MacVim and reading the docs to add support for things I want (NERDTree, fuzzyfinder, surround, closetag) I really love it. I&#8217;m trialling it as my full time editor right now, and it&#8217;s going very well.</p>


	<p>The only thing that annoys me now is that I find myself hitting escape and trying to navigate text in other apps now. Mildly annoying, but more &#8220;damn, I&#8217;m stupid&#8221;!</p></div>
