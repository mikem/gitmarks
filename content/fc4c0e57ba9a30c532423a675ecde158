<P> For several years I had pretty severe wrist pain, and it terrified me.
I had these visions of me with withered stumps at the ends of my arms,
trying to limp along using speech-recognition software, and my career
being over.

<P> These days my wrists are pretty much fine.  People often ask me how
I dealt with it, so I thought I might as well write it up.

<P> First, if you are experiencing pain while typing, <B>do something
about it.</B>  This is incredibly important: this is not one of those
problems that will just go away on its own.  It will only get worse.
And it <I>will</I> get worse.

<P> Most hand/wrist problems are not really ``carpal tunnel syndrome'',
that's a specific kind of ailment, and there are many others.  Carpal
tunnel syndrome is when there is pressure on the median nerve in your
wrist (the channel it passes through on the way from your forearm to
your palm is called the ``carpal tunnel.'')  Much more common is
tendonitis, which is when the various tendons in the arm, hand, and
fingers become inflamed and swell.  (Tendons attach muscle to bone.)
It's extremely common for problems that cause wrist pain to not
actually be in the wrist at all, but in the shoulders, neck, or back, 
and they are certainly exacerbated by crappy keyboards and bad posture.

<P>But one thing is for certain: <B><I>Do not fuck around.  If you are
experiencing any kind of pain, get to a doctor and get it
diagnosed.</I></B>

<P>Pain is a <A HREF="turn.html">signal</A> that something is wrong,
and is going to get worse if you don't fix it.  It doesn't matter what
that something is, you need to do something about it or you run the
risk of permanently damaging your body.

<P> The first thing you should do is read the
<A HREF="http://www.tifaq.org/"><B>Typing Injury FAQ</B></A>.
It's a wonderful document, full of very useful information.

<P><HR WIDTH="40%"><P>

<P> But enough about you, let's talk about me.  There was a period
where my wrist pain was bad enough that I was unable to type for weeks.
It was terrifying.  I'm basically all better now, and here are the
tools I used:

<P><UL>

<LI><B>Acupuncture:</B><P>

  I went twice-weekly for a few months, then weekly or bi-weekly for a
  few more months.  It took a few weeks before I saw any improvement,
  but then I saw a sudden improvement, and a steady increase, until it
  levelled off and stopped helping beyond a certain point.

  <P> Since you're probably wondering, no, it doesn't hurt.  It feels
  very, very strange, but not unpleasant, and not at <I>all</I> like
  being stuck with needles.  It feels more like mild electric shocks,
  or like a very low-grade version of bumping your funny-bone.

<P></LI><LI> <B>Chiropractor:</B><P>

  After I stopped seeing improvement from acupuncture, I started
  seeing a chiropractor, who also practices kinesiology.  I saw her
  weekly at first, then monthly.  I did this for a couple of years.

  <P> What chiropractors do, basically, is align your joints manually.
  The idea is that if your back or neck are out of whack, they are
  going to throw the rest of your body out of whack and cause problems
  elsewhere, as your body tries to compensate.  These problems might
  be through simple mechanical stresses, or through pressure on your
  nerves.

  <P> Kinesiology is a related practice; it's a diagnostic technique
  based on observing various tensions in your body through touch.
  Chiropractors who use kinesiology are using massage-like techniques,
  the theory being that, if your back is out, and the doctor just jams
  it back into place, it's probably just going to go out again
  (because it probably went out in the first place because of muscle
  tension.)  Whereas, if you relax the muscles first, then move the
  bones around, your body won't fight you.

  <P> If you search around on the web, you'll find that some
  practitioners of both Chiropractic and Kinesiology make all kinds of
  hard-<WBR>to-<WBR>understand and harder-<WBR>to-<WBR>believe
  pseudo-<WBR>scientific claims, but I haven't encountered that side
  of things first-hand.

<P></LI><LI> <B>Get a keyboard timer:</B><P>

   <A HREF="http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/xwrits/"><IMG
     SRC="xwrits.gif" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=83 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
   I run a keyboard timer program religiously, and obey it.  I have mine
   configured to start nagging me to take a five minute break after
   I've been typing for forty minutes.  When I was experiencing pain, I
   was taking breaks every twenty minutes instead.  The timer I use is
   called <A HREF="http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/xwrits/">
   <B>xwrits</B></A> (yes, it's really spelled that way.)
   It's quite nice.  The longer you ignore it, the more irritating
   it gets, which is very helpful.

<P></LI><LI> <B>Get out of the chair:</B><P>

  When the keyboard timer goes off, I don't just sit there and wait it
  out, I get up and walk around the room.  I also do the usual
  recommended
  <A HREF="http://www.shelterpub.com/_fitness/_desk_stretches/stretches_graphic.html">stretching exercises</A> (again, go read the 
  <A HREF="http://www.tifaq.org/"> <B>Typing Injury 
  FAQ</B></A> -- really.  Go read it now.  There is a ton
  of information in there.)

<P></LI><LI><B> When it hurts, stop typing:</B><P>

  Yes, what you're doing is of earth-shattering importance, and it has
  to be done <I>tonight</I>, but think what your life is going to be
  like if you can't type <I>at all</I>.  I have friends this has
  happened to.  You seriously <I>do not</I> want to go there.

<P></LI><LI> <B>Get a better keyboard:</B><P>

  Despite the source, I'm a big fan of the

  <A HREF="http://www.tifaq.org/keyboards/fixed-split-keyboards.html#Microsoft Corporation">

  Microsoft Natural keyboard</A> (around $80), and used it for years.

  <P> I spent a couple of days trying out the
  <A HREF="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">Kinesis Contour</A>
  keyboard (the one where the keys are down inside of two
  ``bowls.'')  Lots of people seem to rave about that keyboard, but I
  just couldn't get used to it.  I found it very uncomfortable, I felt
  like it was making my hands actually cramp.

  <P> For the last six months or so, I've been using the 
  <A HREF="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/evolution.htm">Interfaces by Cramer</A>
  keyboard ($400), and I love it.  This keyboard is a thing of wonder:
  it's basically a keyboard that has been cut in half, and you mount
  each half of the keyboard on the arms of your chair, so that you can
  type with your hands at your sides rather than on your desk.  I also
  find that this makes it much easier to <A HREF="tty.html">type</A>
  while sitting in the chair properly: I tend to sit up straight
  instead of hunching forward.

  <P><UL><FONT SIZE="-1">
    Update, Dec 2002: the ``Interfaces by Cramer'' keyboard is now known as
    the ``<A HREF="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/evolution.htm">Kinesis
    Evolution</A>.''  I'm still using mine, and it's held up pretty
    well.  The joints have gotten a little looser.

    <P> Update, Aug 2003: I accidentally spilled a whole glass of water
    into the keyboard, and several keys stopped working.  I bought a
    new Evolution keyboard.  Their policy now seems to be to claim that
    it doesn't work well with Aeron chairs, but in my opinion, it works
    just fine.
   </FONT>
  </UL>

  <P> The only complaint I have about the keyboard itself is that it
  only comes in a track-pad model (no track-point) and there are only
  two mouse buttons (I prefer three.)

  <IMG SRC="chair.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=174 HSPACE=0 VSPACE=4 ALIGN=RIGHT>

  <P> As far as using it goes, it only took me a few hours to get used
  to it, and about a day to be back to my normal typing speed.
  However, if you don't touch-type, you'll have a problem.  I've
  discovered that I never learned to touch-type the top row (numbers
  and symbols) so that tends to slow me down a little.


<P></LI><LI> <B>Get a better chair:</B><P>

  My favorite is the 
  <A HREF="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/product/0,1469,c225-pss7-p8,00.html">
  Herman-Miller Aeron</A> (around $800).  You might think that's a lot
  of money for a chair, but not when you take into account how many
  hours your ass is going to be parked into it, and that it's your
  health we're talking about here.

  <P>If you work for an employer with a decent HR department, they'll
  buy this stuff for you if you complain about pain.  Why?  Because if
  something really goes wrong with your body, they don't want to hear
  the words ``worker's compensation'' or ``work-related injury'' or
  ``law suit,'' so they will do what they can to help you avoid these
  things.

<P></LI><LI> <B>Set up your chair/desk properly:</B><P>

  This is pretty basic, but it really does help: make sure your chair is
  <A HREF="http://www.healthycomputing.com/office/setup/chair/">
  adjusted</A> at the right height for your desk, and that your chair's 
  <A HREF="http://www.tifaq.org/archive/armrests.txt">armrests</A>
  are adjusted for you, and so on.  

  <P> It's all about posture.  Keep in mind that it doesn't matter how
  well your work area is set up if you're still sitting funny: I often
  found myself perching or kneeling in my chair, or sitting on one or
  both legs, even though it seemed like it was set up right.  Somehow
  it just wasn't comfortable to sit upright, and I would sit in odd
  positions.  Eventually I found a solution: a foot-rest.  (I have a
  plastic one, but a couple of <A HREF="shred.html">phonebooks</A> on
  the floor would do as well.)  It turned out that when my chair was at
  the right height for my arms to approach the desk and keyboard from
  the right angle, my feet weren't resting flat on the floor.  Once I
  put something down there to rest my feet on, I started sitting
  properly.

  <P> Also, if your office is cold, keep your hands warm (e.g.,
  fingerless gloves.)  Circulation is important, and when your hands
  are cold, the blood vessels constrict.

<P></LI><LI> <B>Exercise:</B><P>

  For me, it's <A HREF="cement.html">bicycling</A>.  If you're
  generally healthy, your body repairs itself more readily.  No really,
  it's true.  You need to get off your ass, or your body will
  malfunction far more often.

</LI></UL>

<P> So I was lucky, and it turned out that my pain was from mild
tendonitis, and muscle tension in my hands, which was in turn caused by
neck and back tension resulting from poor ergonomics, lack of sleep,
lack of exercise, stress, and just too damned much 
<A HREF="nscpdorm.html">typing</A>.  These things heal if you treat 
them early enough.

<P> Why did I do <A HREF="http://www.acupuncture.com/">acupuncture</A>?
Well, I tend to place more faith in Eastern medicine
than Western for things like this, both because you tend to get more
personalized care (your HMO is going to misdiagnose you and put you on
the wrong assembly line) and because the holistic approach just makes
more sense to <NOBR>me --</NOBR> your body is good at healing itself,
if its healthy.  You need someone who is going to look at the big
picture.  It's easy for their terminology to scare you
away, with talk of Qi flowing and being blocked and so on, since we
know that's not <I>really</I> what's going on, but look at it this way:
Newtonian mechanics isn't <I>really</I> what's going on either, but
it's a model, and it works really well almost all the time.

<P> But there is a lot of empty-headed new-agey snake-oil out there,
too, as any web search on <A HREF="http://www.hcrc.org/">these
topics</A> will reveal.  Skepticism is also healthy.

<P> But whatever: if you go the Western route, <B>and</B> are lucky
enough to be diagnosed properly, what will happen is that you'll end up
seeing a physical therapist for a few hours a week, doing all kinds of
exercises to strengthen the parts of your body that have been taking a
beating (wrists, back, neck, whatever it happens to be.)  That will
work too.

<P> However, another argument in favor of acupuncture is that the
other sort of physical therapy <I>hurts</I>, not to mention is much
more time-consuming.

<P> I know folks who have done both.  Do what you're comfortable with.

<P> Some people will tell you that mice are the root of all evil, and
that the key to avoiding wrist pain is to stop using the mouse and
learn to use keyboard equivalents for everything.  Well, in my case, I
found it to be just the opposite.  I used to be one of those people who
never used a mouse unless absolutely necessary; now I use the mouse as
much as possible.  (It's the act of switching back and forth between
the mouse and keyboard that you want to minimize, for efficiency.)

<P> This is a very personal thing, it depends on your body, your chair,
your keyboard, your usage patterns, all kinds of things.  There's no
one source of the problem, and no one quick fix.  What works for you
won't work for everybody.

<P> Some random other bits of advice; your mileage may vary:

<P><UL>

  <LI> <B>Beware of wrist braces.</B><P>

  A lot of people try to self-diagnose themselves, and will pick up a
  cheap set of wrist braces at a drug store and just wear those while
  typing.  Wrist braces can help, but they can also do even more
  damage.  You shouldn't wear them for too long.  What they're good for
  is providing relief to stressed-out muscles and inflamed tissues
  (removing weight and letting them relax).  Sometimes doctors will
  prescribe that you wear them to bed, to prevent you from sleeping
  with your wrists all torqued out under your body with the circulation
  cut off.  But, if you wear them for too long, your muscles will just
  <A HREF="nipples.html">atrophy</A>, and your problems will get worse.
  There's a balance between overworking a muscle and not using it at
  all.

  <P></LI><LI> <B>Beware of keyboard pads.</B><P>

  Remember, you're not supposed to be resting your hands/arms on the
  desk at all while you're using the keyboard or mouse.  A padded
  surface <I>might</I> just be making it more comfortable for you to
  type improperly.

  <P></LI><LI> <B>Your keyboard has two Shift keys for a reason.</B><P>

  Learn to use them!  Use the opposite hand for chording.  For example,
  if you type Shift-A, your right hand should shift and your left hand
  should do the A.  If you do it all with your left hand, you're going
  to be crunching your hand up into a funny position.

  <P></LI><LI> <B>Try remapping your keys.</B><P>

  It's complete lunacy that modern keyboards give up choice real-estate
  to the Caps-Lock key, while tucking a tiny control key away in the
  bottom left.  If you use Control more than Caps, 
  <A HREF="../xkeycaps/">swap</A> them.  

<!--
  <P> I've also tried other mappings over time; for example, I find
  that I type <TT><B>()</B></TT> much more often than
  <TT><B>[]</B></TT>, so I have my keyboard mapped so that the
  <TT><B>[{</B></TT> key generates <TT><B>([</B></TT> instead.  Also, I
  put <TT><B>{</B></TT> and <TT><B>}</B></TT> on the <B>F9</B> and
  <B>F10</B> keys, so that I can type those without shifting.

  <P> For a while I felt like (being a C programmer) I was typing 
  underscore a lot more often than hyphen, so I swapped the positions
  of <TT><B>-</B></TT> and <TT><B>_</B></TT> (so that underscore was
  the unshifted character on that key.)  I decided that this was more
  of a hassle than it was worth, though.
-->

</LI></UL>


<P><HR WIDTH="40%"><P>


<P> The bottom line is, <I><B>don't ignore the pain, do something
about it.</B></I>  I've had friends damage themselves permanently.  
(For example, read about 
<A HREF="http://www.666.com/ben/alternative-input.html"> Ben Wing's</A>
struggles.)  If it hurts, find out why, and do something about it!

<P> Good luck...
