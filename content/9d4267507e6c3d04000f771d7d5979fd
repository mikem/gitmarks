    <p>
      C-&gt;Haskell is an interface generator that simplifies the development
      of <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> bindings to C libraries.
      The tool processes existing C header files that determine data layout
      and function signatures on the C side in conjunction with Haskell
      modules that specify Haskell-side type signatures and marshaling
      details.  Hooks embedded in the Haskell code signal access to C
      structures and functions -- they are expanded by the interfacing tool in
      dependence on information from the corresponding C header file.  Another
      noteworthy property is the lightweight nature of the approach.  The idea
      for the tool was developed during the implementation of <a
      href="../gtk/">Gtk+HS</a>, a Haskell binding for the GUI toolkit <a
      href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+.</a>  The latter is no longer under
      active development, but its successor, <a
      href="http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/">Gtk2Hs</a>, also uses C-&gt;Haskell.

      The latest news:
    <ul>
      <li><small>[3 May 2010]</small>
	Duncan Coutts
	just released version 0.16.2, which works with GHC 6.12.
      </li>
      <li><small>[28 February 2009]</small>
	Duncan Coutts
	just released version 0.16.0 "Crystal Seed", which uses the new package 
	<code>Language.C</code> that Benedikt Huber recently extracted from
	C-&gt;Haskell's code base.  Moreover, it has better support for OS X,
	implements enum hooks, and had several bugs fixed.
      </li>
      <li><small>[24 November 2007]</small>
	Duncan Coutts
	just released version 0.15.1 "Rainy Days".  This release builds with
	GHC 6.4 through to 6.8 and also properly supports OpenBSD and Windows.
	Moreover, the documentation has been updated.
      </li>
      <li><small>[31 August 2007]</small>
	Duncan Coutts
	just released version 0.15.0 "Rainy Days".  This release includes
	Duncan's new parser with excellent gcc compatibility and an improved
	build system.
      </li>
      <li><small>[2 January 2006]</small>
	Updated the the C-&gt;Haskell darcs repository with modifications by
	Ganesh Sittampalam to fix a problem when pulling on windows/cygwin.
      </li>
      <li><small>[14 May 2006]</small>
	The C-&gt;Haskell darcs repository moved to <a
	href="http://darcs.haskell.org/"><code>darcs.haskell.org</code></a>
	and Duncan Coutts is now a second maintainer of the tool.  (He's the
	one who heroically rewrote C-&gt;Haskell's parser.)
      </li>
      <li><small>[12 December 2005]</small>
	Source release 0.14.5 brings in addition to bug fixes support for
	typedef'ed pointers to structs/unions (thanks to Jelmer Vernooij) and
	enables to suppress code generation for pointer hooks with a
	<code>nocode</code> directive. 
      </li>
<!--
      <li><small>[15 November 2005]</small>
	Binaries for 0.13.6 are now in Debian unstable, thanks to Marco Tulio
	Gontijo e Silva.
      </li>
      <li><small>[10 August 2005]</small>
	Source release 0.14.3 adds support for cross compilation (i.e., the
	platform for which code is to be generated can be specified using the
	new flag <code>--platform</code>).  Moreover, two new built-in
	translation functions <code>upcaseFirstLetter</code> and
	<code>downcaseFirstLetter</code> are available.
      </li>
      <li><small>[7 August 2005]</small>
	Source release 0.14.2 adds support for gcc's <code>asm</code>
	construct and for hierarchical modules in import hooks, both due to
	Duncan Coutts.  Moreover, the wrapper scripts are more robust.
      </li>
      <li><small>[15 July 2005]</small>
	Source release 0.14.1 "Travelling Lightly" contains a
	completely new build system based on Cabal 1.0.1.  It also contains a
	completely new C lexer and parser contributed by Duncan Coutts, which
	is generated by Alex and Happy instead of using parser combinators -
	this reduces memory consumption for large C libraries dramatically.
	Finally, the <code>C2HS</code> library is now added to the generated
	bindings in source form; as a result, a C-&gt;Haskell build is <em>no
	longer</em> specific to a particular Haskell system.  Moreover, the <a
	href="#darcs">darcs repository</a> has an RSS feed.
	<strong>Important:</strong> To build this new version, you need at
	least Cabal <strong>1.0.1</strong>; version 1.0 of Cabal (as, e.g.,
	distributed with GHC 6.4) is <strong>not</strong> sufficient.  (I
	tested this code only with GHC 6.4 and Cabal 1.0.1, but older versions
	of GHC may work, too.  Nhc98 may work as soon as it is properly
	supported by Cabal.)
      </li>
      <li><small>[18 May 2005]</small>
	Version 0.13.6 has been released.  It supports GHC 6.4.  Thanks to
	Andr&eacute; Pang for most of the porting work.  Moreover,
	C-&gt;Haskell is now maintained in a <a
	href="#darcs">darcs repository.</a>
      </li>
      <li><small>[18 October 2004]</small>
	Source release 0.13.4 that allows identifier to be put in single
	quotes to avoid collisions with C-&gt;Haskell keywords in hooks and
	fixes some bugs (handling of newlines after cpp directives,
	identifiers generated in function hooks, and the package conf file).
      </li>
      <li><small>[13 October 2004]</small>
	Source release 0.13.2 that fixes some bugs and adds an
	<code>--output-dir</code> option (thanks to Volker Wysk for the
	suggestion).
      </li>
      <li><small>[8 October 2004]</small>
	Added rpms for 0.13.1 compiled with GHC 6.2.1 on Fedora Core 2.
      </li>
      <li><small>[11 June 2004]</small>
	Source release 0.13.1 "Pressing Forward" can deal with header files
	containing function bodies and complies completely with the H98 FFI
	Addendum.  Moreover, it's performance significantly increased after a
	space leak identified by Duncan Coutts has been removed.
	See the release notes for further information <a
	href="docu/c2hs-8.html#ss8.1">release notes</a>.
      </li>
      <li><small>[19 October 2003]</small>
	Source release 0.12.0 "Springtime" works with GHC 6.3, builds on Mac
	OS X, and contains Jens Petersen's new rpm spec file.  The Mac OS X
	port has been contributed by Sean Seefried.
      <li><small>[19 October 2003]</small>
	Jens Petersen's new split rpms are available for 0.11.5.</li>
      <li><small>[10 June 2003]</small>
	Version 0.11.5 improves some aspects of the build system and includes
	support for GHC 6.0.  It is a full binary release.</li>
      <li><small>[22 April 2003]</small>
	Version 0.11.4 is a bug fix, source-only release.  (Fixes a bug
	in determining the size of a union.)
      <li><small>[16 April 2003]</small>
	Version 0.11.3 is a bug fix, source-only release.
      <li><small>[13 February 2003]</small>
	Version 0.11.1 "Powder Snow", which is a source-only testing release,
	is now available.  This version introduces CPP directives, including
	support for conditional compilation, as well as inline C code in
	binding modules.  See the release notes for further information <a
	href="docu/c2hs-8.html#ss8.1">release notes</a>.
      <li><small>[13 February 2003]</small>
	There is now a <a href="#ml">mailing list</a> for C-&gt;Haskell.
      <li><small>[17 September 2002]</small>
	The new version 0.10.17 of C-&gt;Haskell circumvents the bug in GHC
	5.04.1 that makes 0.10.16 unusable.
      <li><small>[16 September 2002]</small>
	An rpm package of version 0.10.16 compiled for GHC 5.04.1 is now
	available.
	<br> <font color="a00050"><strong>Warning:</strong></font> Do
	<strong>not</strong> use 
	C-&gt;Haskell with GHC 5.04.1.  Due to <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=609944&group_id=8032&atid=108032">a bug</a> 
	in GHC, the reading of <code>.chi</code> does not work.
      <li><small>[9 September 2002]</small>
	Version 0.10.16 is now also available as a <a
	href="http://freshports.org/devel/hs-c2hs/">FreeBSD port</a>; thanks
	to Oliver Braun.
      <li><small>[7 September 2002]</small>
	Full binary release, version 0.10.16 "Altocumulus Stratiformis
	Perlucidus Undulatus".  The functionality is the same 
	as in 0.10.15, but some small fixes have been applied.  For details on
	the improvements since the last binary release, consult the <a
	href="docu/c2hs-8.html#ss8.1">release notes</a>.
      <li><small>[6 September 2002]</small>
	Version 0.10.15 is now also available in <a
	href="http://packages.debian.org/c2hs">Debian unstable</a> (thanks to
	Michael Weber) and as a <a
	href="http://freshports.org/devel/hs-c2hs/">FreeBSD port</a> (thanks
	to Oliver Braun).
      <li><small>[12 July 2002]</small>
	Released source tar ball for version .  In addition to small
	fixes it improves the handling of GNU C's <code>__extension__</code>
	keyword, which bothered some people.  If there are no immediate
	problems with this version, I'll provide binaries for it, too.
      <li><small>[3 July 2002]</small>
	Put a source-only release out to compensate for the lack of anonymous
	CVS service at the moment.  This release is essentially what I plan to
	put into the next full binary release, but I won't get around to
	putting this out this month.
      <li><small>[12 March 2002]</small>
	CVS version
	0.10.10 has a revised build system that doesn't use an explicit build
	tree anymore.  (After updating from CVS, remove the <code>build</code>
	tree and run <code>autoreconf</code> followed by
	<code>./configure</code>)
      <li><small>[25 February 2002]</small>
	0.10.8 includes a major new feature, namely "function hooks".  See the
	included documentation for details.
      <li><small>[13 February 2002]</small>
	CVS version
	0.10.7 now supports GHC's package management system.
      <li><small>[15 January 2002]</small>
	0.10.6 contains a number of bug fixes and is needed to compile the CVS
	version of Gtk+HS.
      <li><small>[14 November 2001]</small>
	CVS version
	0.10.2 properly supports bitfields in structs (struct offsets are
	computed correctly, and bitfields can be extracted and set using
	<code>get</code> and <code>set</code> hooks)
      <li><small>[17 October 2001]</small>
	The current
	binary release version 0.9.9 "Blue Ginger" is now available in Debian
	unstable, courtesy of Michael Weber.
      <li><small>[8 October 2001]</small>
	0.10.x "Altocumulus Stratiformis Perlucidus Undulatus" in CVS: added
	class hooks (see description in <code>c2hs.sgml</code>)
      <li><small>[27 August 2001]</small>
	version 0.9.9 "Blue Ginger"; see the <a
	href="docu/c2hs-8.html#ss8.2">release notes</a> for details
      <li><small>[21 June 2001]</small>
	CVS version
	0.9.8 introduces sizeof hooks and fixes bugs.
      <li><small>[18 June 2001]</small>
	0.9.7 fixes a bug in handling constant expressions - thanks to Armin
	      Sander for the patch.
      <li><small>[16 June 2001]</small>
	0.9.6 has support for a local prefix in enum hooks and
	additional bug fixes - thanks to Armin Sander for code and suggestions.
      <li><small>[21 May 2001]</small>
	CVS version
	0.9.5 has additional bug fixes.
      <li><small>[13 May 2001]</small>
	Meanwhile, many bug fixes to the new features have appeared in CVS.
      <li><small>[2 May 2001]</small>
	The CVS HEAD now
	has a couple of new features: works with GHC 5.00; support for
	parametrised pointers; new <code>pointer</code> hook, which supports
	the use of <code>ForeignPtr</code> and <code>StablePtr</code> as well
	as abstract (newtype) pointers; and a <code>deriving</code> option for
	the <code>enum</code> hook.  This revision has greatly benefitted from
	Axel Simon's suggestions and code
	contributions.  There is also some more documentation.  NB: This code
	is little tested, but help with testing is, of course, very welcome.
      <li>C-&gt;Haskell
	version 0.8.2 "Gentle Moon" source-only intermediate release for the
	new FFI Marshalling Library.  A truck load of bugs fixed since 0.8.1.
 -->
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, the C-&gt;Haskell compiler is available for the Glasgow
      Haskell Compiler only.  However, the only extension needed over Haskell
      98 and the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ffi/">H98 FFI Addendum</a> are existential data types.  (The latter are
      only needed for the C-&gt;Haskell compiler itself, but not for the
      accompanying marshaling libraries.)  Partial support for nhc98 is in
      place, but so far there have always been some bugs in nhc98 that
      prevented to complete the port.

      If you plan to install C-&gt;Haskell, you probably like to read the <a
      href="docu/">C-&gt;Haskell Tutorial.</a>  There is also
      <a href="../../papers/papers.html#c2hs">a research paper</a> about the
      tool.  To get an idea of how to use the interface generator -- after the
      build -- go to the directory <tt>c2hs/tests/</tt>, which
      contains a number of small examples of binding files with matching C
      header files.  Most interesting is <tt>Structs.chs</tt> as well as 
      <tt>Pointer.chs</tt> as well as the corresponding C source and header
      files.  The binding file contains
      instructions on how to generate an executable from it.
