				<p>As more people become interested in Lean ideas and their application to knowledge work and project management, it&#8217;s helpful to find ways that make it easier to get started or learn a few basic concepts that can lead to deeper insights later.  For those that are curious about kanban in an office context, it&#8217;s not unusual to find people who are either currently using Scrum, or have some understanding of Scrum as representative of Agile thinking.  One way or another, Scrum users are an important constituent of the Kanban audience.  Since Scrum can be described as a statement in the language we use to describe kanban systems, it is also fairly easy to elaborate on that case in order to describe Scrum/Kanban hybrids.  This can be useful for existing Scrum teams who are looking to improve their scale or capability.  It can also be useful for more cautious new users who find comfort in an &#8220;established&#8221; method<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-001.jpg' style="float:right;margin-left:1em;" />The idea of using a simple task board with index cards or sticky notes is as old as Agile itself.  A simple variation of this is a task board with a simple<em> Pending -> In Process -> Complete</em> workflow.  The cards represent work items that are in the current scope of work.  Names can be associated with the cards to indicate who&#8217;s working on what.  Agile teams have been using this sort of method for a long time, and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783" target="_blank" >few</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Management-Software-Engineering-Constraints/dp/0131424602" target="_blank" >people</a> pointed out early on that this had some resemblance to the notion of kanban in lean systems.</p>
<p>Of course, a variety of electronic tools exist that perform these functions, but the simple task board represents a couple of lean principles that I find very valuable, <em>simple technology</em> and <em>visual control</em>.  The utility of such a simple method of workflow management is that it is easy to manage, and more importantly, <em>it is easy to change</em>.  Huddling around a computer monitor, even a very large one, is in no way a substitute for the tactile and social interactivity that accompanies manipulating a large task board.  Maybe someday it will.  Not today.  What electronic tools are good for are managing lists of things, like backlogs and bugs, and producing reports.  Simple tools can be a difficult concept to explain to technology fanatics, but then, so can <em>value</em>.</p>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-002.jpg' style="float:left; margin-right:1em;" />A problem with the basic index-card task board is that there is nothing to prevent you from accumulating a big pile of work in process.  Time-boxing, by its nature, sets a bound on how much WIP that can be, but it can still allow much more than would be desirable.  </p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p>If a kanban is a token that represents a work request, and our task board can still get out of control, then what is the problem here?  The problem is that a kanban is more than just a work request on a card, and putting sticky notes on a whiteboard is not enough to implement a pull system.</p>
<h4>A kanban is more than an index card</h4>
<p><br/><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/eur5.jpg' style="float:left;margin-right:1em"/>In a modern economy, the production and distribution of scarce goods and services are regulated by a system of money and prices.  Money can be represented by currency notes, which have little intrinsic value, but that by agreement, can be exchanged for real goods and services.  The existence of a neutral medium of exchange makes possible a system of economic calculation of the relative scarcity of the supply of goods in an economy.  Such a system of prices is a market.  Markets communicate the value of economic production and distribution to their participants.   </p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/zimbabwenote.jpg' style="float:right;margin-left:1em" />If a currency note can be exchanged for an object of real value, then there must be some way to enforce the scarcity of the notes in a way that corresponds to the scarcity of real value in the economy.  In practice, some kind of institution must enforce this scarcity.  The health of a market economy depends greatly on the ability of its monetary institution to coordinate the supply of money with the supply of goods and services.  In an unhealthy economy, unstable prices make economic calculation difficult and disrupt the communication between producers and consumers needed for efficient production and distribution.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p>A kanban represents a portion of the productive capacity of some closed internal economy.  It is a medium of exchange for the goods and services provided by the operations of a system of productive resources.  The supply of kanban in circulation is controlled by some regulatory function that enforces its value.  That is, a kanban is a kind of private currency and the shop floor manager is the bank that issues it, for the purpose of economic calculation.</p>
<p>If you carry the currency analogy further, then you might say that kanban is not about the cards at all.  Just like money is not about the bills.  Kanban is all about the limits, the quantity in circulation.  How that is represented in a transaction is mostly incidental.</p>
<p>A simple rule for understanding all of this might be:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em"><em>A task card without a limit is not a kanban in the same way that a photocopy of a dollar bill is not money.</em></p>
<p>If you use a durable token like a plastic card, then this is easy to manage:  control the number of cards in circulation.  If all of the available cards are already in circulation, then the next person who comes looking for one is just going to have to wait until one returns.  <em>This is the very purpose of the kanban system.</em>  However, if you use a more disposable medium like index cards or sticky notes, then you need another mechanism to regulate the &#8220;money supply.&#8221;  In our case, we simply write the quantity of kanban in circulation on the task board, and allocate new cards according to that limit.</p>
<p>This means that a kanban serves two functions:  it is a request to do something in particular, but it is also permission to do something in general.  That second notion of permission is where people who are new to lean thinking tend to struggle.  But this is precisely how we can &#8220;optimize the whole&#8221; or &#8220;subordinate to the constraint.&#8221;</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<h4>Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside</h4>
<p><br/>Just as an unregulated index card on a cork board is not a kanban, time-boxed iteration planning is not pull.  No reasonable interpretation of Lean involves building to a one-month forecast unless the cycle time for each work order is also a month.  One month worth of stuff in process is certainly a much smaller batch size than 3 months or 18 months, but if your iteration backlog contains 20 work items, then that&#8217;s still about 19 more than it needs to be a pull system.  </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is not difficult to augment Scrum with a few simple practices that move us towards a more recognizably lean workflow.  The most obvious is the reduction of iteration length, although this is not without problems<sup>2</sup>.  As we&#8217;ll see, it&#8217;s possible to incrementally enhance Scrum with more and more pull-like features until all that remains of the original process is vestigial scaffolding.  The simple approach is to start with Scrum-like iterations and iteration planning process, and begin to add pull features to the team&#8217;s internal process.</p>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-003.jpg' style="float:right; margin-left:1em" />One simple technique that brings us much closer to our kanban definition is to set a multitasking limit for individuals.  You might have a simple principle like:  <em>prefer completing work to starting new work,</em>  or you might express that as a rule that says:  <em>try to work on only one item at a time, but if you are blocked, then you can work on a second item, but no more</em>.   In our example, that rule gives us an effective WIP limit of 6.</p>
<p>Another common technique is the late binding of tasks to owners.  Some teams will pre-assign all of the known tasks during iteration planning.  That&#8217;s generally not a good idea because it artificially creates a critical path.  Waiting until the &#8220;last responsible moment&#8221; to assign tasks to people maximizes knowledge and brings you closer to pull.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-004.jpg' style='float:left; margin-right:1em' />Just because <em>anybody</em> can have more than one item in process doesn&#8217;t mean that <em>everybody</em> should have more than one item in process.  A problem with our multitasking rule is that it locally optimizes with no consideration of the whole.  An implicit total WIP limit of 6 is still more WIP than we should probably tolerate for our three workers.  A limit of 4 of 5 total items in process at one time still allows for some multitasking exceptions, but disallows the obviously dysfunctional behavior of everybody carrying two items.  At this step, we have moved beyond a rule about individuals and have made a rule about the task cards themselves.  That is, we have made our cards into kanban.</p>
<p>Another enhancement we can make to our previous board is to add a ready queue between the backlog and work-in-process.  The ready queue contains items that are pending from the backlog, but have high priority.  We still haven&#8217;t bound any individual to these tasks, but as soon as somebody becomes available, they should take one of these tasks instead of picking something out of the general backlog.  This enables us to decouple the process of assigning work from the process of prioritizing work, and it simplifies assignment.  The ready queue also has a kanban limit, and it should be a small limit, since its only purpose is to indicate which work item should be started next.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p>Now we can begin to see some of the mechanics of pull and flow:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-005.jpg' style='width:157px' /></td>
<td><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-005a.jpg' style='width:157px'/></td>
<td><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-006.jpg'  style='width:157px'/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>1. David completes a task and moves it into the &#8220;done&#8221; column.</em></td>
<td><em>2. David pulls a new kanban from the ready queue and begins working.</em></td>
<td><em>3. The team responds to the pull event and selects the next priority item to go into the ready queue.</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>At this point, we are now operating a simple kanban pull system.  We still have our time-boxed iteration and planning cycle, so perhaps we might call such a thing a Scrumban system!</p>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-007.jpg'  style="float:right;margin-left:1em"/>Now that we have a sense of capacity and pull, it&#8217;s natural to think about flow.  Breaking up our nebulous &#8220;in process&#8221; state into better defined states can give everybody more visibility into the strengths, weaknesses, and overall health of the team.  Even Agile workflows like Extreme Programming have relatively well-defined roles and states, and a smooth flow of work between those states is just as important as a smooth flow of work through the process overall.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ve broken down <em>in-process</em> into two states:  <em>specify</em> and <em>execute</em>.  Specify is about defining whatever criteria are necessary to determine when the work item can be considered complete.  Execute is about doing the work necessary to bring that work item into a state which satisfies those criteria.  We have split our previous WIP limit of 5 across these two states.  Specify is considered to take less time in this case, so it is given a limit of 2.  Execute consumes the remaining limit of 3.  We might change this ratio as time goes on and our performance changes.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.agilemanagement.net/Images/Pictures/sampleCFD032004.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:1em" />Since we are now thinking more about flow, the additional workflow detail strongly suggests using a Cumulative Flow Diagram to track the work and measure our performance.  A simple burndown tells you something about whether or not you are delivering value, but not very much about why.  The CFD communicates a lot of additional information about lead times and inventories that can diagnose problems, or even prevent them.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p>By defining our workflow a little better, we can also account for some functional specialization.  In this case, it might be a soft specialization, where some of us prefer doing one type of work more than another, even though we&#8217;re capable of doing it all.  It&#8217;s important to understand that this kind of pull workflow system <em>allows</em> specialization but does not <em>enforce</em> specialization.  The team owns the work and the workflow, and it&#8217;s up to the team to figure out how to get it done efficiently.</p>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-008.jpg' style="float:right;margin-left:1em" />If we let the person who&#8217;s best at performing the &#8220;specify&#8221; function handle more of that work, then we may also need to coordinate handoffs between ourselves.  Adding the <em>specify-complete</em> column communicates to the team that a work item which was previously in the specify state is now ready to be pulled by anyone who wants to move it to the execute state.  Work that is still in the specify state is not eligible to be pulled yet.  If the owner of a ticket in the specify state wants to hand it off, he can put it in the complete buffer.  If he doesn&#8217;t want to hand it off, he can move it directly into the execute state as long as capacity is available.  It might be that the execute state is full, and the only eligible work is to pull another ticket from the ready queue into specify.</p>
<p>Since we have added a new column for our handoff buffer, we are also increasing the WIP limit by a small amount.  The tradeoff is that the increase in lead time due to the new inventory should be offset by the decrease in lead time due to the advantage of specialization.  We also mitigate the impact of that new inventory by pooling the WIP limit across the preceding state.  This has the very beneficial consequence of making the specify-complete buffer a variable throttle for the preceding station.  The more work that piles up in the specify-complete buffer, the less work can be in process in the specify state, until specify is shut down entirely.  But we see it coming, it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;just happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to allow workflow specialization and the handoffs that result, then we will also need some agreement about what results to expect at each handoff.  We can do that by defining some simple work standards or standard procedures for each state.  These do not have to be complicated or exhaustive.  Here, they are simple bullets or checklists drawn directly on the task board.  They only need to be sufficient to avoid misunderstanding between producers and consumers.  These standards are themselves made and owned by the team, and they can change them as necessary according the practice of <em>kaizen</em>.  Putting them in a soft medium like a whiteboard or a wiki reinforces the notion of team ownership.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<h4>Level 2 Scrumban</h4>
<p><br/>In the basic version of Scrumban described so far, the iteration review and planning cycle happens just as it does in ordinary Scrum.  But as our production process has matured, we have also given ourselves some tools to make the planning process more efficient, more responsive, and better integrated with the business that it serves.</p>
<p>With the pull system in place, our flow will become smoother as our process capability improves.  We can use our inter-process buffers and flow diagrams to show us our process weaknesses and opportunities for kaizen.  As we get closer to level production, we will start to become less concerned with burndown and more concerned with cycle time, as one is the effect and the other is the cause.  Average lead time and cycle time will become the primary focus of performance.  If cycle time is under control and the team capacity is balanced against demand, then lead time will also be under control.  If cycle time is under control, then burndowns are predictable and uninteresting.  If burndowns are uninteresting, then goal-setting and risky heroic efforts are unnecessary.  If burndowns are uninteresting, then iteration backlogs are just inventory for the purpose of planning regularity and feeding the pull system.  As such, they should be the smallest inventories possible that optimize planning cost.</p>
<p>Since the team now pulls work into a small ready queue before pulling it into WIP, then from the team&#8217;s perspective, the utility of the iteration backlog is that it always contains something that is worth doing next.  Therefore, we should use the least wasteful mechanism that will satisfy that simple condition.</p>
<p><img src='http://leansoftwareengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scrumban-009.jpg'  style="float:right;margin-left:1em"/>A simple mechanism that fits the bill is a size limit for the iteration backlog.  Rather than go through the trouble of estimating a scope of work for every iteration, just make the backlog a fixed size that will occasionally run to zero before the planning interval ends.  That&#8217;s a simple calculation.  It&#8217;s just the average number of things released per iteration, which in turn is just a multiple of average cycle time.  So if you have 5 things in process, on average, and it takes 5 days to complete something, on average, then you&#8217;ll finish 1 thing per day, on average.  If your iteration interval is two work weeks, or 10 work days, then the iteration backlog should be 10.  You can add one or two for padding if you worry about running out.  This might be a point that&#8217;s been lost on the Scrum community:  it&#8217;s never necessary to estimate the particular sizes of things in the backlog.  It&#8217;s only necessary to estimate the average size of things in the backlog.  Most of the effort spent estimating in Scrum is waste.</p>
<p>In our final incarnation of Scrumban, iteration planning still happens at a regular interval, synchronized with review and retrospective, but the goal of planning is to fill the slots available, not fill all of the slots, and certainly not determine the number of slots.  This greatly reduces the overhead and ceremony of iteration planning.  Time spent batch processing for iteration planning estimation can be replaced with a quality control inspection at the time that work is promoted to the ready queue.  If a work item is ill-formed, then it gets bounced and repeat offenders get a root cause analysis.</p>
<h4>Off with the training wheels</h4>
<p><br/>If you have made it this far in your evolution, you will probably realize that the original mechanisms of Scrum are no longer doing much for you.  Scrum can be a useful scaffold to hold a team together while you erect a more optimized solution in place.  At some point you can slough off the cocoon and allow the pull system to spread its wings and take flight.</p>
<p>The first step beyond Scrum is to decouple the planning and release periods.  There may be a convenient interval to batch up features to release, and there may be a convenient interval to get people together to plan.  If we have a leaner, more pull-driven planning method, there&#8217;s really no reason why those two intervals should be the same.  Your operations team might like to release once a month, and your product managers might like to establish a weekly prioritization routine.  No reason not to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve broken up the timebox, you can start to get leaner about the construction of the backlog.  Agility implies an ability to respond to demand.  The backlog should reflect the current understanding of business circumstances as often as possible.  Which is to say, the backlog should be event-driven.  Timeboxed backlog planning is just that, where the event is a timer, but once we see it that way, we can imagine other sorts of events that allow us to respond more quickly to emerging priorities.  Since our system already demonstrates pull and flow, that increased responsiveness should come at no cost to our current efficiency.</p>
<p>The problem we are trying to solve is:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em"><em>The ideal work planning process should always provide the development team with best thing to work on next, no more and no less.</em></p>
<p>Further planning beyond this does not add value and is therefore waste.  Scrum-style timeboxed planning usually provides a much bigger backlog than what is strictly necessary to pick the next work item, and as such, it is unnecessary inventory and therefore unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>The next event we might consider for scheduling planning activities is the concept of an <em>order point</em>.  An order point is an inventory level that triggers a process to order new materials.  As we pull items from the backlog into the process, the backlog will diminish until the number of items remaining drops below the order point.  When this happens, a notice goes out to the responsible parties to organize the next planning meeting.  If our current backlog is 10, our throughput is 1/day, and we set an order point at 5, then this planning will happen about once a week.</p>
<p>Once a week might be reasonable if people are hard to schedule or need some lead time in order to prioritize.  However, if they are more available than that, then we can set the order point lower.  If the planners can respond within a day, then perhaps we can set the order point at 2.  If the order point is 2, then there may be no need to keep a backlog of 10.  Perhaps we can reduce the backlog to 4&#8230;and reduce our lead time by 6 days in the process.</p>
<p>The end state of this evolution is pull, or prioritization-on-demand.  If the planners can make a good decision quickly enough, and there is no economy of scale in batching priority decisions together, then the size of the backlog only needs to be 1.  At the moment the item is pulled by the development team, the planning team is signaled to begin selecting the next item.  If the planning team is fast enough in their response, then the development team will never stall.  If there is some variation or delay in reponse, then a backlog of 2 might be necessary to prevent stalls.  But 2 is still a lot smaller and leaner than 10.  Or 20.  Or 50, which is something I&#8217;ve seen more often than I would like.</p>
<p>The same kind of logic can be applied to the release interval.  There is an optimum batch size for releases and we should first try to find it, and then try to improve it.  The result of our efforts will ultimately be features-on-demand.</p>
<p>Even at this level, we still have a fairly basic kanban system.  From here we can add <a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2007/10/27/kanban-bootstrap/">work item decomposition</a> (swimlanes), or <a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2007/12/09/kanban-flowing-according-to-architecture/">structural dependency flow</a> for additional scale.  Along with an <a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2008/02/10/division-of-labor-in-lean-software-development-workflows/">enlightened division of labor</a>, this is how we believe that Lean shows the way to scale Agile up to the enterprise.</p>
<hr />
1.  in spite of the fact that the kanban idea is at least 40 years older<br />
2.  which I&#8217;ll probably write about in another post sometime</p>

								<p>Hi Corey,</p>
<p>Your post is really interesting and I&#8217;ve done exactly what you&#8217;ve described above with one of my clients who found it massively useful&#8230;despite being really hesitant at first. They were also doing scrum (loosely and in inverted commas) and were struggling so I got them back to Scrum proper in the fall of last year and then introduced the kanban idea&#8217;s almost the way you described above over a month or so with great results. Couple of things I wanted to get your take on:</p>
<p>One thing that I didn&#8217;t get round to changing with them was how they sized their stories &#8211; they&#8217;re using Story Points but I&#8217;m wondered what your take on that would be?</p>
<p>Also how does this pull based work fit into a release plan? Scrum based teams have their velocity based on completed story points and can then do some basic release management work (e.g. it&#8217;ll be roughly 4 iterations (or sprints) before all these stories would be completed and you can draw the burndown from this information. If you&#8217;re not doing development iterations anymore what happens to velocity and how Scrum teams traditionally use it to track progress?</p>
<p>I mention this last question as that is one that will come up a lot with Scrum teams and may be worth amending the article to cover.</p>

								<p>While I 99.44% agree with this post, I think there is still some detail that needs to be filled in.  For example</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s only necessary to estimate the average size of things in the backlog. Most of the effort spent estimating in Scrum is waste.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would say this is true if there is managed variation in the size of the backlog.  For example, all PBIs could be constrained to be small (e.g., everything is &#8220;3 ideal days or less&#8221;) and all PBIs bigger than that broken into smaller PBIs (I think this helps support single piece flow).  At some point the product owner needs to judge PBIs based on value (e.g., ROI).  How can they do that if they are just basing each PBI&#8217;s value based on an average?</p>

								<p>@Rob,</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s really great to hear about your results.  We love hearing kanban stories from the field!</p>
<p>I think story point limits are a legitimate variation on kanban limits.  It adds a little complexity to do it that way, but I wouldn&#8217;t object if somebody felt that was best for them.</p>
<p>I knew somebody would call me on the release planning question.  I will be writing more about that in the near future, and we&#8217;ll be discussing it at the APLN conference in Seattle next week.  </p>
<p>Throughput is continuously calculated as work items complete.  We&#8217;re managing throughput directly by managing work-in-process and cycle time.  Kanban is all about fixing work-in-process, and that leaves us with cycle time which we manage with value stream and theory of constraints methods and such.</p>
<p>Release planning consumes the historical throughput metric, and can apply methods like Minimum Marketable Features, Staged Delivery, and Rolling Wave Planning.  That&#8217;s what we recommend: a rolling wave planning event on a regular cadence.</p>
<p>“Toyota naturally makes production schedules…Just because we produce just-in-time in response to market needs…does not mean we can operate without planning”</p>
<p>“First, the Toyota Motor Company has an annual plan. This means the rough number of cars…to be produced and sold during the current year. Next there is the monthly production schedule…Based on these plans, the daily production schedule is established in detail and includes production leveling.”</p>

								<p>@Hank,</p>
<p>Limiting the size of work items for downstream scheduling is one of the things we recommend.</p>
<p>A kanban workflow can extend the value stream before and after the typical boundaries of a Scrum team, so that some of the work that the Product Owner does is pulled into the workflow and managed accordingly.  Size and effort estimates can be produced as a natural consequence of analysis, since that analysis has to be done anyway.</p>

								<p>@Hank,</p>
<p>Heaven knows I don&#8217;t expect anybody to agree with me 100%.  You rightly point out the significance of work item sizing to single piece flow, and that is spot on.</p>
<p>Mostly, I want to help facilitate a conversation about the implications of pull and flow for software development.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that pull and flow are &#8220;right&#8221; in some absolute sense, although I personally find them to be extremely compelling.  But if we decide that pull and flow are the right answer, then this blog is mostly about figuring out what that really means, and I very much appreciate the feedback that I get here.</p>

<p>Lean processes are built for competition. If &#8220;good enough&#8221; process is good enough for you, then perhaps textbook Scrum is adequate for your purposes. Comfortable is a luxury, so I hope you enjoy it. </p>
<p>Maybe you are not in a competitive situation. Maybe your competitors are inept. If, however, you are under any pressure for systematic performance improvement, then the suggestions in this article address inefficiencies that are built into Scrum.</p>

								<p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>Firstly, a pull system creates what I&#8217;d call an &#8220;event-rich environment,&#8221; which means there is a great deal of context and opportunity for introspection and process improvement.  The pull system is giving you permission to not wait until your next &#8220;official&#8221; retrospective to change something.  &#8220;Pink tickets&#8221; or &#8220;Andon lights&#8221; ought to trigger a process that can lead to a root-cause analysis and process improvement.</p>
<p>Secondly, there should often be some kind of planning process or rhythm above the level of individual work item scheduling.  This particular article showed how you could use the Scrum framework for that purpose. You could also schedule retrospectives around lower-frequency events like release of an MMF.   If your MMFs are sufficiently &#8220;M&#8221; then you might use their natural rhythm to trigger planning events.  Or you could schedule a regular event that may or may not coincide with some other planning or release event.  One suggestion is a 2-week integration/release cadence, with a 6-week (or semi-quarterly) rolling wave planning event.</p>

								<p>Corey,</p>
<p>Great article!  I&#8217;m applying this to game development where there is a transition from exploring the game mechanics (fun) using Scrum to the production phases where we develop 8-12 hours of assets using a Lean-Kanban approach.  Your description of Scrumban is perfect for transitioning the team.</p>
<p>The main thing that would prevent us from trying Scrumban across the whole project is the concern oflosing a major benefit of the iteration. Preproduction (Scrum) iterations are ideal for a &#8220;unifying audacious goal&#8221; for the team.  We don&#8217;t know all of our tasks (often only 50%), so we leave room in the schedule for exploration.  Leveling development, decoupling iteration planning from review&#8230;this seems to deprecate audacious iteration goals.</p>
<p>Am I overlooking something?<br />
Thanks<br />
Clint</p>

								<p>Clint,</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you very much!  Part of the thinking about the Scrumban approach is that it allows you to keep old practices that have value to you, add new practices that have value to you, and drop ones that don&#8217;t.  I told one story here about an evolution of a process, but there are other stories that could also be told.  You could do a lot of the things that are in the article without giving up iterations.  And the point was meant to be that you would only give them up if/when you recognized that they no longer have value for you.  If that never happens, then you wouldn&#8217;t give them up!</p>
<p>One thing I left out of this article was project or product planning, which can provide additional context and motivation.  It seems like I only write about this in the comments&#8230;but I will have an article soon about the relationship between Minimum Marketable Features, Rolling Wave Planning, Real Options, and Kanban.</p>

<p>Specify/execute is only an example.  The boundary was meant to approximate what-to-build vs. how-to-build-it. </p>
<p>Specify is meant to be the &#8220;operational definition of the problem statement&#8221;.  That could be things like requirements specifications, test cases, and wireframes.  In turn, these things could be represented by things like user stories and automated acceptance tests.</p>
<p>Execute could be schematics, design verification tests, source code, integration, acceptance testing and other V&#038;V.</p>

								<p>Thanks for this article, Corey. I am leading a Production Support/Minor Enhancement team in a development shop where all the features teams are using Scrum and I&#8217;ve been looking for a way to implement an Agile/Lean methodology which would tolerate the constant interruptions inherent to application support and maintenance.

								<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still pretty early, so much of the evidence is still anecdotal or speculative.  David Anderson has real data on pull system performance in general.  Clinton Keith has specific data on Kanban vs Scrum.  There may be some others, possibly Dave Laribee or Karl Scotland.  A good place to ask would be on the Yahoo! kanbandev group.</p>

For instance, I learned about Lisa&#8217;s upcoming book on Agile Testing (pre-ordered), Esther&#8217;s love of gardening and good food and have a ring-side seat between the always colourful Ron Jeffries (@RonJeffries) and Bob Martin (@unclebobmartin).

								<p>We&#8217;re implementing kanban for our IT Operations; still in the prototyping phase but it&#8217;s helped so far to visualize our bottlenecks. I&#8217;ve posted a few pictures on my blog with little explanation and hope to expound in the future.</p>
<p>Just a quick note on page 55 of your book, I found the passing reference to Axiomatic Design to require a bit more explanation. It&#8217;s a bit coming out of nowhere and I&#8217;d love to have more details.</p>

								<p>Hi Corey,<br />
 A wonderful article and a great way to simplify Kanban learning. I don&#8217;t get this line- &#8220;This might be a point that’s been lost on the Scrum community: it’s never necessary to estimate the particular sizes of things in the backlog. It’s only necessary to estimate the average size of things in the backlog&#8221;</p>
<p>What is meant by estimating average size of things? All things are not the same. Let us say I have 5 MMFs in my in process (Specify) and my initial task is to find the lead time so that I can identify the limits for my backlog.</p>
<p>I find that the lead time for 5 MMFs is 20 days. This means 1 MMF takes 4 days. If my sprint is 10 business days I could complete approx 3 MMFs. This would mean my backlog limit could be 3. But these 5 MMFs have varying sizes. If I have to identify MMFs of similar sizes to fit in my backlog (3) I would have to spend considerable time planning, breaking stories etc.. In the process if I don&#8217;t find MMFs that could fit the 3 backlog limit then what happens?</p>

								<p>This is a great mechanism for working.  This is not at all saying this can not work, but one contextual item where a pull system may NOT work is if during Sprint Planning, you estimate when you need a particular user to help with refining the requirements (story).  You can&#8217;t just pull, because you &#8220;scheduled&#8221; that person at a particular time most likely for a reason (perhaps they weren&#8217;t available).  At the very least, it could become a problem as you would be giving them last minute notice.</p>
<p>Again, this is not to say this technique can&#8217;t work, but just to provide a case where it may be more difficult as a consideration for those thinking of using it.  If the user (and perhaps it is the product owner, but often he or she may not be) can be totally dedicated to the team or at least to that Sprint, then this could be problematic.</p>
<p>Great post and I&#8217;ll be looking for where I can apply these concepts.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />
Paul</p>

								<p>[...] Once you get work showing on your Kanban board you will see where work is piling up.&#160; Excess work in process raises a number of challenges. It increases the time a new item will take to travel through the system. It indicates the likelihood of an overburden on the current performers or the next performers. For example, in Scrum iterations when there is a lot of work in development that all moves to test at the end of the iteration – this is undesirable.&#160; You can limit WIP in a number of ways.&#160; In Scrum, we limit WIP at the iteration boundary and some teams limit WIP by limiting the number of work items that can be active at any one time. The Kanban board calls for explicit WIP limits and also recommends buffer columns to mitigate the impact of variation to keep work flowing through the system. You can certainly explicitly limit WIP and include a buffer or buffers on a normal Agile board. Here is a essay from Lean Software Engineering showing ScrumBan. [...]</p>
