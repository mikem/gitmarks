  and Julie Sussman's <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> 
  (MIT Press, 1984; ISBN 0-262-01077-1), an excellent computer science text used 
  in introductory courses at MIT. So called because of the wizard on the jacket. 
  One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as the 
  Purple Book.

  <p> This site is a companion to the influential computer-science text <a
href="/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262011530"><i><b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer 
    Programs</b></i></a>, by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. Its purpose is to 
    demonstrate the Web's potential to be a channel for innovative support for 
    textbook users. 
  <p> The material on this site is aimed at instructors using <i>SICP</i> as a 
    course text, and at people using the book for self-study.

      to get Scheme</a></strong><br>
      <em>SICP</em> uses the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Scheme implementations are 
      available for most common platforms. From MIT, we supply free implementations 
      of the MIT Scheme programming environment. This page provides information 
      on how to obtain copies of MIT Scheme as well as other implementations.
