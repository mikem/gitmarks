    <h2>The uzbl web interface tools</h2>
    <p>Uzbl follows the UNIX philosophy - &quot;Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.&quot;
    Uzbl comes in different flavors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>uzbl-core: main component meant for integration with other tools and scripts
        <ul>
          <li>Uses WebkitGtk+ for rendering, network interaction (libsoup).  Css, javascript, plugin support etc come for free</li>
          <li>Provides interfaces to get data in (commands/configuration) and out (events): stdin/stdout/fifo/unix sockets</li>
          <li>You see a webkit view and (optionally) a statusbar which gets popuplated externally</li>
          <li>No built-in means for url changing, loading/saving of bookmarks, saving history, keybinds, downloads, ...</li>
          <li>Extra functionality: many sample scripts come with it, on <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/scripts">uzbl wiki</a> or write them yourself</li>
          <li>Entire configuration/state can be changed at runtime</li>
          <li>Uzbl keeps it simple, and puts <strong>you</strong> in charge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>uzbl-browser: a complete browser experience based on uzbl-core
        <ul>
          <li>Uses a set of scripts (mostly python) that will fit most people, so things work out of the box.  Yet plenty of room for customisation</li>
          <li>Brings everything you expect: url changing, history, downloads, form filling, link navigation, cookies, event management etc.  However: one page per instance</li>
          <li>Advanced, customizable keyboard interface with support for modes, modkeys, multichars, variables (keywords) etc. (eg you can tweak the interface to be vim-like, emacs-like or any-other-program-like)</li>
          <li>Adequate default configuration</li>
          <li>Focus on plaintext storage for your data and configs in simple, parseable formats and adherence to the xdg basedir spec</li>
          <li>Visually, similar to uzbl-core except that the statusbar contains useful things.  One window per webpage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>uzbl-tabbed: wraps around uzbl-browser and multiplexes it
        <ul>
          <li>Spawns one window containing multiple tabs, each tab containing a full embedded uzbl-browser</li>
          <li>Ideal as a quick and simple solution to manage multiple uzbl-browser instances without getting lost</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Uzbl is under heavy development and should be considered alpha.  See the <a href="/get.php">Get uzbl</a> page</p>

                <p><p>Hey folks! Things have been quiet here for a while, but uzbl is still steadily
improving. In the last 3 months we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fixed a bug that caused uzbl-tabbed to hog CPU time after closing a tab
  <li>introduced a C cookie daemon that uses a much faster algorithm than
      uzbl-cookie-daemon
  <li>fixed a crash when opening an image in a new window
  <li>fixed several memory leaks
  <li>added <code>SCROLL_VERT</code> and <code>SCROLL_HORIZ</code> events, which
      allow us to display the scroll percentage in the status bar again
  <li>added the <code>show_inspector</code> command to show the Web Inspector
  <li>added the <code>enable_pagecache</code> variable to enable the <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basics/">Webkit Page Cache</a>
  <li>added some new default keybindings
  <li>refactored the default shell scripts to share code
  <li>and fixed and tidied lots of other little things
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Ben Boeckel, Michael Raskin, Daiki Ueno, Lars-Dominik Braun and
Pawe≈Ç Zuzelski for these patches, and for keeping development active! (Thanks
also to those whose patches still need to be merged, I'll be getting to those
too.)</p>

<p>There's still a lot that all of us can do to help make uzbl better, and a lot of
cool things that uzbl can do for us. I'm looking forward to seeing what people
come up with!</p>

                <span class="date">2010-11-21</span>
                <p><p>Hi,
as of today Brendan Taylor (aka 'bct') will be the new uzbl maintainer / project leader.</p>

<p>Uzbl started about a year and a half ago as an experiment, an attempt to make web browsing more bearable for hackers.
We didn't always make the right choices, but at the very least it has been an interesting journey.
I think we've done innovative things.  Uzbl (and browsers in general) still have a way to go, but at least the browsing experience is now tolerable.
Partly because of our work on uzbl, partly because of some other cool browser projects that have appeared since.</p>

<p>Personally I've lost of interest in devoting much of my spare time on Uzbl. 
I have other projects going on (open source stuff, and real life projects), and
I want to be more a user, less a coder.</p>

<p>There are various foss projects where progress goes slowly - releases taking easily a year or more - but that's not how I want it to be for Uzbl.
Uzbl has clearly an active user/contributor base and it's sad to see to the pile of pending patches / pull requests just getting bigger and bigger.
In the spirit of "release early, release often" I think the project also needs somebody who can at least keep up with, and preferrably, drive the progress.
There's still so much innovation which can be done, and now I feel I'm holding it back.</p>

<p>Brendan has been a long time contributor, he seems to know what he's doing, and he has some things he wants to tackle,
so I'll think he's the right person for the job.
He'll share his plans with you guys shortly.</p>

<p>Practically, to keep things simple, the repositories stay the same.
That is:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl">http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl-website">http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl-website</a></li>
</ul>
Brendan will be the guy deciding what goes in and what doesn't.
He'll be the one deciding over your pull requests and patches (but again: community feedback is always welcome!)
He'll also be the one defining the direction of the project, and he's in charge of the website/wiki/bugtracker/...
(although we of course all pitch in where we can, right ;-)</p>

<p>So, welcome Brendan!</p>

<p>Dieter</p>
