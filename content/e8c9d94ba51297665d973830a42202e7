Everyday I receive an email from somebody about how their account was hacked, how a friend tagged them in the photo and they want a way to avoid it, as well as a number of other complications related to their privacy on Facebook.  Over the weekend one individual contacted me to let me know that he would be removing me as a friend from Facebook because he was &#8220;going to make a shift with my Facebook use &#8211; going to just mostly family stuff.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Perhaps he was tired of receiving my status updates or perhaps he didn&#8217;t want me to view photos from his personal life.  Whatever the reason for ending our Facebook friendship, I figured that many people would benefit from a thorough overview on how to protect your privacy on Facebook.  Below is a step by step process for protecting your privacy.<br />

<h2>1. Use Your Friend Lists</h2>
<p><img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/friend-lists-icon.gif' width='166' height='160' align='left' alt='-Friend Lists Icon-' />I can&#8217;t tell you how many people are not aware of their friend lists.  For those not aware of what friend lists are, Facebook describes them as a feature which allows &#8220;you to create private groupings of friends based on your personal preferences. For example, you can create a Friend List for your friends that meet for weekly book club meetings. You can create Friend Lists for all of your organizational needs, allowing you to quickly view friends by type and send messages to your lists.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few very important things to remember about friend lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add each friend to more than one friend group</li>
<li>Friend groups should be used like &#8220;tags&#8221; as used elsewhere around the web</li>
<li>Friend Lists can have specific privacy policies applied to them</li>
</ul>
<div style='width:175px;float:right;background-image:url(/images/privacy-ebook.gif);width:225px;height:245px;background-repeat: no-repeat;'>
<form action="http://socialtimes.createsend.com/t/r/s/aidn/" method="post">
<div style='padding:120px 0 0 22px;'>
<p><input type="text" name="cm-name" id="name" value="Name" onclick="javascript:this.value='';"  /></p>
<input type="text" name="cm-aidn-aidn" id="aidn-aidn"value="Email" onclick="javascript:this.value='';" />
<input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</div>
</form>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ll touch on each of the things listed above in more detail later.  A typical setup for groups would be &#8220;Friends&#8221;, &#8220;Family&#8221;, and &#8220;Professional&#8221;.  These three groups can then be used to apply different privacy policies.  For example, you may want your friends to see photos from the party you were at last night, but you don&#8217;t want your family or professional contacts to see those photos.  </p>
<p>Using friend lists is also extremely useful for organizing your friends if you have a lot of them.  For instance I have about 20 friend lists and I categorize people by city (New York, San Francisco, D.C., Tel Aviv, etc), where I met them (conferences, past co-workers, through this blog), and my relationship with them (professional, family, social, etc).  </p>
<p>You can configure your friend lists by visiting the <a href='http://www.facebook.com/friends/'>friends area</a> of your Facebook.</p>
<h2>2. Remove Yourself From Facebook Search Results</h2>
<p style='text-align:center;'>

</p>
<p>My mom is a teacher and one of the first things she asked me when she joined Facebook is how she could make sure her students couldn&#8217;t see that she was on the site.  Understandably my mom doesn&#8217;t want her middle school students to know what she&#8217;s up to in her personal life.  There are numerous reasons that individuals don&#8217;t want their information to show up in search results on Facebook, and it&#8217;s simple to turn off your public visibility.  </p>
<p><strong>How to Remove Yourself From Facebook Search Results</strong><br />
Now that you&#8217;ve decided that you would like to remove yourself from Facebook&#8217;s search results, here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit your <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search'>search privacy settings page</a></li>
<li>Under &#8220;Search Visibility&#8221; select &#8220;Only Friends&#8221; (Remember, doing so will remove you from Facebook search results, so make sure you want to be removed totally.  Otherwise, you can select another group, such as &#8220;My Networks and Friends&#8221; which I believe is the default.)</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, Facebook makes your presence visible to the network you are in.  Frequently, people aren&#8217;t aware of their visibility, so this is one of the first settings that users wish to modify.  By selecting &#8220;Customize&#8221; from the search visibility drop down you can make your settings even more granular. </p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>

</p>
<h2>3. Remove Yourself From Google</h2>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/public-search-listing2.gif' width='520' height='241' alt='-Public Search Listing Screenshot-' />
</p>
<p>Facebook gets <em>A TON</em> of traffic from displaying user profiles in search engines.  Not all of your profile is displayed though.  Currently the information displayed in the search profile is limited to: your profile picture, a list of your friends, a link to add you as a friend, a link to send you a message, and a list of up to approximately 20 fan pages that you are a member of.  </p>
<p>For some people, being displayed in the search engines is a great way to let people get in contact with you, especially if you don&#8217;t have an existing website.  Facebook also tends to rank high in the search results, so if you want to be easy to find, making your search profile can be a great idea.  Many people don&#8217;t want any of their information to be public though.  </p>
<p>By visiting the same <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search'>search privacy settings page</a> listed in the previous step, you can control the visibility of your public search listing which is visible to Google and other search engines.  You can turn off your public search listing by simply unchecking the box next to the phrase &#8220;Create a public search listing for me and submit it for search engine indexing&#8221; as pictured in the image below.</p>

<h2>4. Avoid the Infamous Photo/Video Tag Mistake</h2>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/drunk-tag.gif' width='390' height='143' alt='-Drunk Tagged Facebook Photo-' />
</p>
<p>This is the classic Facebook problem.  You let loose for a few hours one night (or day) and photos (or videos) of the moment are suddenly posted for all to view, not just your close friends who shared the moment with you.  The result can be devastating.  Some have been fired from work after incriminating photos/videos were posted for the boss to see.  For others, randomly tagged photos/videos have ended relationships.</p>
<p>At the least, a tagged photo/video can result in personal embarrassment.  So how do you prevent the infamous tagged photo or video from showing up in all of your friends news feeds?  It&#8217;s pretty simple.  First visit your <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile'>profile privacy page</a> and modify the setting next to &#8220;Photos Tagged of You&#8221;.  Select the option which says &#8220;Customize&#8230;&#8221; and a box like the one pictured below will pop up.</p>
<p>Select the option &#8220;Only Me&#8221; and then &#8220;None of My Networks&#8221; if you would like to keep all tagged photos private.  If you&#8217;d like to make tagged photos visible to certain users you can choose to add them in the box under the &#8220;Some Friends&#8221; option.  In the box that displays after you select &#8220;Some Friends&#8221; you can type either individual friends or friend lists.  </p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>

</p>
<h2>5. Protect Your Albums</h2>
<p><img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/facebook-albums.gif' width='205' height='198' align='left' alt='-Facebook Photos Profile Screenshot-' />Just because you&#8217;ve uploaded photos doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ve accurately tagged every photo correctly.  This setting is more of a reminder than anything else.  Frequently people will turn of their tagged photo visibility to certain friend lists yet keep their photo albums public to the world.  If you are trying to make all your photos invisible you must do so on an album by album basis.  </p>
<p>There is a specific <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos'>Photos Privacy page</a> from which you can manually configure the visibility of each album (as pictured below).  This is an extremely useful configuration option and I highly recommend that you take advantage of it.  This way you can store your photos indefinitely on Facebook yet ensure that the only people that can view your photos are the ones who you really want to see them.</p>

<h2>6. Prevent Stories From Showing Up in Your Friends&#8217; News Feeds</h2>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/relationship-status-notify.gif' width='200' height='22' alt='-Relationship Status Notification Change Option Screenshot-' />
</p>
<p>Oh, did you really just break up with your girlfriend?  I&#8217;m sorry to hear that.  I&#8217;m sure all of your friends and business contacts are also sorry to hear that.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many awkward relationship status changes I&#8217;ve seen.  The most regular one I&#8217;ve seen recently is when an attractive female ends their relationship and numerous guys hop on the opportunity to console her.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also seen the end of marriages, as well as weekly relationship status changes as individuals try to determine where their relationship stands with their significant other.  My personal policy is to not display a relationship status, but many like to make a public statement out of their relationship.  For those individuals, it can be a smart move to hedge against future disasters.  </p>
<p>There are a number of ways to control how your relationship status is displayed.  The first thing that most people should do is uncheck the box next to &#8220;Remove Relationship Status&#8221; in the <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=feeds'>News Feed and Wall Privacy page</a>.  In the rare instance that a relationship does uncomfortably end, you can avoid making things more uncomfortable by avoiding a friend notification about it.</p>
<p>Second, your relationship status falls within your &#8220;Basic Information&#8221; section of your profile.  You can control who can see your basic information next to the &#8220;Basic Information&#8221; setting on the <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile'>Profile Privacy page</a>.  Keep in mind that other relevant profile information like your gender, birth date, networks, and other settings are visible within your basic information section.  </p>
<p>Making your basic information completely invisible to friends probably isn&#8217;t a good idea, but removing the news feed stories about relationship changes most likely is.<br />

<h2>7. Protect Against Published Application Stories</h2>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/have-sex-notify.gif' width='458' height='29' alt='-Have Sex! Notification Screenshot-' />
</p>
<p>This one is a little more tricky to manage but I&#8217;ll explain the issue at hand.  Frequently when you add an application, a news feed item is immediately published to your profile.  One way to get instantly embarrassed is to visit the &#8220;Have Sex!&#8221; application (<a href='http://www.facebook.com/applications/Have_Sex!/5282518924'>found here</a>).  This application has no purpose besides telling your friends that you are interested in having sex with them.  Without taking any action, the application will post a news feed story to your profile which says the equivalent of &#8220;Nick just published to the world that he is having sex!&#8221;  </p>
<p>This is surely something that none of your professional contacts if any of your contacts are interested in seeing (honestly I&#8217;m a bit confused about that application, but that&#8217;s a different story).  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to monitor what takes place after you install an application on Facebook.  Once you install an application you should visit your profile to ensure that no embarrassing notification has been posted to your profile.  </p>
<p>More often then not, nothing will be posted but there are many applications on the platform unfortunately that publish stories without you knowing it.  There are two ways to avoid having this happen: don&#8217;t visit applications or scan your profile every time that you do.  Ultimately you shouldn&#8217;t be concerned about applications that you&#8217;ve built a trusted relationship with but any new applications could potentially post embarrassing notifications.</p>
<h2>8. Make Your Contact Information Private</h2>
<p>I personally use Facebook for professional and personal use and it can frequently become overwhelming.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve taken the time to outline these ten privacy protection steps.  One of the first things I did when I started approving friend requests from people that I hadn&#8217;t built a strong relationship with, was make my contact information visible only to close contacts.</p>
<p>The contact information is my personal email and phone number.  It&#8217;s a simple thing to set but many people forget to do it.  Frequently people we don&#8217;t know end up contacting us and we have no idea how they got our contact information.  Your contact privacy can be edited right from your profile.  If you have chosen to enter this information, you should see a &#8220;Contact Information&#8221; area under the &#8220;Info&#8221; tab in your profile.</p>
<p>If it displays, you simply click &#8220;Edit&#8221; and then a screen like the one pictured below will show up.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/profile-contact.gif' width='520' height='530' alt='-Profile Contact Edit Form Screenshot-' />
</p>
<p>For each contact item that you have in your profile you should set custom privacy settings (as pictured below) so that contacts that you aren&#8217;t close to don&#8217;t have access to your phone number and/or email.  It&#8217;s a small change but it can save you the hassle of being pestered by people you don&#8217;t know well.  Also, protecting your privacy is generally a good practice to get in the habit of doing.  </p>
<p>As a side note, this is a great area to take advantage of friend lists.  By getting in the habit of grouping your friends, you can ensure that you are navigating Facebook safely through privacy settings that are attached to your friend lists.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>

</p>
<h2>9. Avoid Embarrassing Wall Posts</h2>
<p>Just because you use Facebook for business doesn&#8217;t mean your friends do.  That&#8217;s why once in a while a friend of yours will come post something embarrassing or not necessarily &#8220;work friendly&#8221; and it can end up having adverse effects.  That&#8217;s why Facebook has provided you with the ability to customize your wall postings visibility.  You can also control which friends can post on your wall.  There are two places you can control these things.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust Wall Posting Visibility</strong></p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/images/wall-stories-settings.gif' width='520' height='103' alt='-Facebook Wall Story Settings Screenshot-' />
</p>
<p>Within your profile page you can control who can view wall postings made by your friends.  To do so, click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; icon on the wall in <a href='http://www.facebook.com/profile.php'>your profile page</a>.  Next, find the box pictured in the image above and adjust the setting which says &#8220;Who can see posts made by friends?&#8221;  I&#8217;d suggest using a strategy similar to the one outlined in the previous step regarding contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Control Who Can Post to Your Wall</strong><br />
In addition to controlling who can view wall postings published by your friends, you also want to control which friends can post on your wall.  Not everybody needs to do this, but occasionally you simply want to prevent some people from posting on your page.  If you visit the <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile'>Profile Privacy settings page</a>, there is a section labeled &#8220;Wall Posts&#8221;. </p>
<p>From this area you can completely disable your friends&#8217; ability to post on your wall.  You can also select specific friend lists that can post on your wall.  Personally, I don&#8217;t really care who can post on my wall but I can understand the need to control who can see those wall postings.  If you want to limit who can post wall posts on your profile, <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile'>this is where you can do it</a>.</p>
<h2>10. Keep Your Friendships Private</h2>
<p>While it&#8217;s fun to show off that you have hundreds or thousands of friends on Facebook, some of your friends don&#8217;t want to live public lives.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s often a good policy to turn off your friends&#8217; visibility to others.  I&#8217;ve had a number of individuals visit my profile and then selectively pick off friends that are relevant to them for marketing purposes, or other reasons.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason they are doing it, just know that they are &#8230; it&#8217;s part of what makes Facebook so addictive: the voyeuristic nature.  Also, your friends are frequently visible to the public through search engines and exposing this information can ultimately present a security risk.  To modify the visibility of your friends, visit the <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile'>Profile Privacy page</a>.</p>
<p>Navigate down to the setting which says &#8220;Friends&#8221; and then modify the setting to whatever is right for you.  </p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>

</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are just ten ways that you can protect your privacy on Facebook.  While there are a few other small things to keep in mind, these ten settings are most important.  Keep in mind that while you may have turned off the visibility of many profile sections, there is no way to prevent all photos or videos from being visible if friends of yours make the images visible.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent embarrassing items from showing up on Facebook in the future is to not make bad judgements in your personal life.  We&#8217;re all human though and being completely paranoid about every choice you make is probably not the best way to live your life.  Be aware of what privacy settings are available and be conscious of what your friends may be publishing about you.  </p>
<p>While you may not want to configure all of the privacy settings outlined, simply knowing how to do so is a great step in the right direction.  By following the 10 settings listed above you are well on your way to an embarrassment free future on Facebook!<br />

	<p>Nick,</p>
<p>Thanks for putting this together. I can&#039;t tell how many of my friends are COMPLETELY unaware about 95% of this issue &#8211; especially the photo/video tag situation.</p>
<p>The more people that are aware of the Facebook default settings (and how &quot;exposed&quot; they leave you) the better.</p>

	<p>Thanks for posting this! What I don&#039;t understand is why Facebook won&#039;t create a privacy setting that would allow you to approve or deny photo tags before they can appear on your profile.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t mind having some of my tagged photos available to people, so I don&#039;t necessarily want to make them completely private. But I just want the option to block a photo tag BEFORE someone tags a photo of me &#8212; not remove the tag after the fact, when people might have already seen a picture.</p>

	<p>This is what I&#039;m looking for. For more privacy I would like to suggest that we can hide number of friend that I have. I don&#039;t want my friend to see that. I also want function like block certain user to comment at my wall or pics or notes or posted item. I also want to see function to hide specific friend status. Its annoying when somebody keep update same status specifically if its related to promoting something.</p>

	<p>Or, for the ultimate privacy, you could avoid facebook all together. In case you forgot, there was a guy named Alexander Bell over a century ago, invented the telephone. You might want to start using that. And snail mail still works. Plus, with that info, no matter what, a message can get through. As an additional, it is far harder for snoops to get access to the info, you cannot get fired for those communiques and you can prevent stupid pictures from getting out for the world to see.</p>
<p>Try it for a week, see what not using the sites can do for you.</p>
<p>I tried those social networking sites, and after less than an hour on each, I decided never to use them at all. Saved my job when my friends got fired cause of facebook and myspace.</p>

	<p>Faisal, all those things can be done in Facebook. Number of friends hidden? #10 above. Block users? set up groups (#1 above) then allocated permissions.

<p>Nick, I blogged about this, because one of our Australian newspapers (Murdochs news.com.au) grabbed provocative Facebook status updates and published them as &quot;news&quot;.

	<p>This information will be put to great use by the many job seekers I work with.  What seems friendly and fun during good times, can easily work against the professional suddenly looking for a job.</p>
<p>Thanks for listing all of these in such a clear and consise way.</p>

	<p>Really helpful. One thing I&#039;d wish to add : Facebook privacy settings differ, depending on which country you opened your account.</p>
<p>I&#039;m in France and some of the settings you were suggesting were turned on automatically. Meaning that Facebook could make them standard settings, but that&#039;s another story&#8230;</p>

	<p>I use the friends lists to great effect, however one thing I would really REALLY like is a list of all friends NOT in a group. If I don;t remember to do this when I first connect up with a friend they can sometime languish in &#039;no mans land&#039; and I&#039;m never too sure what a person in this state can or can&#039;t see&#8230;</p>

	<p>So these are really important suggestions. So important that at the very least some of them should be default settings in FB. IMO, FB should have a pretty tough job defending the current default settings which as you put it have cost some people their jobs and relationships due to no fault of theirs.</p>

<p>RE: Friend Lists</p>
<p>So, friends lists are a fine idea, but Facebook&#039;s application of the concept is cumbersome, at best.</p>
<p>What Facebook SHOULD provide is Drag &amp; Drop function where we have a friends source list (photo, name, which of your friends list they currently exist within).</p>
<p>And a &quot;drop zone&quot; for each Friend List.</p>
<p>This way we could drag and drop friends and not have to bother with the current approach which is a combination of</p>
<p>a) start typing the name, and/or</p>
<p>b) pick n number of contacts from this impossibly long scrolling list.</p>
<p>Of course, methods for managing lists should also be developed. E.g., delete list/group, manage what the people in this list/group can see, etc.</p>
<p>The drag &amp; drop approach would enable us to easily manage who appears in which list, but also offer a way to manage different permission levels.</p>
<p>Drag and Drop is the answer, Facebook.</p>

	<p>Nick, this is an absolute coincidence! A group of my friends were actually wondering how effective FB privacy settings were after I put up some party pics. I had to assure them that I&#039;d tagged my pic album as &quot;Only Friends&quot; &amp; that others would not be able to view them. However, on further testing I discovered that the public URL that&#039;s posted at the bottom of the page for others can enable folks outside of those I&#039;d designated to view my photo album. I reported this obvious limitation to FB immediately. Does this then mean that Friends of Friends could see them as well? Would they be notified of their friends being tagged in FB albums via the News Feed?</p>
<p>FB privacy settings are quite extensive, but they have to work properly in order to place complete faith in them. The thoughtful feature that FB did support was the ability for tagged friends to &quot;un-tag&quot; themselves.</p>
<p>Your post is much needed especially when FB grows &amp; folks from all times of your life start discovering you. I&#039;ve also started feeling that I should pare my friends list down to those I&#039;ve stayed in touch with over the years. </p>
<p>Additionally, FB could easily create automatic Friend groups that used your captured association data when one connected with someone. This would help users quickly apply the right privacy setting based on the groups they selected without having to actually go through the tedious task of organizing each of these connections.</p>

	<p>Thanks for taking the time to post this Nick.</p>
<p>I have been venturing into various social websites lately but not FB yet.  </p>
<p>Apart from their &#8220;Terms Of Use&#8221;, if I have read it right, of allowing them to use your content, which may have intellectual property (IP) rights, for their own advertising purposes while you are a member, these security issues you have raised are also a concern.</p>
<p>I have learnt in the past,<br />
- from other peoples actions on chat forums that it is best not to upload anything onto the internet that you wouldn&#8217;t want the public to see and<br />
- secondly, from some writer about deciding what to do in different situations and possibly common sense: Don&#8217;t do anything you would not want your mother to find out (or substitute another caring person you admire and respect or your boss). This may be a way to measure if your conscience is letting you know not to do a thing before any evidence is created and/or published.  If this was the case, then maybe FB can remain a social tool without changing the default security settings too much.</p>

<p>Great info, just one thing: I followed the steps to avoid my friends to see other friends of mine and it worked (when they look at my profile), but in their mainpage they still have in these &quot;suggestions/people you may know&quot; list my friends, saying they have me in common. So you can avoid your friends to see your list of friends, but they will know them anyway&#8230; I think it&#039;s a big facebook hole, isn&#039;t it?</p>

	<p>Great article, the more people that become aware of available privacy settings, the better.</p>
<p>The big one I would add to your list is blocking what applications your friends use can see &#8211; by default, much of what your friends can see about you can be seen by any application that they authorize (not which ones *you* authorize).  </p>
<p>Especially if you have friends who are prone to click on every application that catches their eyes (surely I&#039;m not the only one who has a few of those), but probably for even the most innocent apps, do the app creators really need to know all of my personal info from where I live to my relationship status to my religion? I think not!  It&#039;s under the privacy settings area, under applications settings.</p>

	<p>My interpretation of this post can be summarized as, &#8220;Facebook privacy settings are too confusing for Facebook&#8217;s users.&#8221; This post would not exist if Facebook UX and docs were clear. It&#8217;s a shame, but if it were easy for users to control the use of their PII then Facebook would suffer. Facebook, quite simply, is incentivized to make their privacy settings confusing.</p>
<p>I emailed Facebook privacy support to explain that I don&#8217;t think reasonable people would think that &#8220;Use this to control who can see the full list of your friends on Facebook&#8221; means &#8220;(same) except for search results which ignore this setting.&#8221; Their response was to tell me that they looked at my privacy settings, and people could not see me in search results. I replied that they completely missed the point and that unless they had escalated the issue to their manager, I was shocked that they had read access rights to my settings. I no longer tell people that Facebook is trustworthy.</p>

	<p>I think this information is great!  Thank you.  I would however like to suggest that an application is added to facebook that allows you to preview a piture tagged of you BEFORE it hits your profile.  Although the picture may not be indecent, it may not be one that you would like shown to everyone who can view your page &#8211; and has logged on before you.</p>

	<p>Bunch of fools, you realise your selling your identity to Facebook when you sign up, they own your data and you can never get it back, you can&#8217;t delete your profile so basically your giving away every single thing about yourself including where you like to socialise, where you work, your relationships with people, your likes, where you are. Facebook has the power to completely map out your life and how your connected to every person you know. Also the people who ploughed millions of pounds into a social networking website are very high powered political figures, you people should think about what your giving up when joining such a website I.E. freedom.</p>

	<p>Its such a great information on how popular is facebook. Its also told us how irresponsible people or parties are making use of it for their own benefit. And of course to do smearing campaigns.Its also good when the users being educated on the proper use of facebook to disseminate information as well as to promote harmony and understanding among people of various nationalities.However we should be aware that people of dubious characters would also infiltrate in this largest social networkings to cause havoc and insecurity to the users especially the naive and teenage users.So facebook can be a two-edge knife, that should be handled properly.</p>

	<p>Great Resource! Thanks for posting this article. An email has been doing the rounds which highlighted a BIG technical glitch on about photo and profile privacy that most people don&#039;t even &#039;know&#039; about! Can anyone please give a solution for this?</p>
<p>(1) First, in the &#039;Privacy Settings under &#039;Basic&#039;,the first option asks who should be able to see your &quot;Profile&quot;. What exactly do they mean by &quot;Profile&quot;? As in, if you choose &quot;Only friends&quot; for this first question, then don&#039;t all the other questions i.e. personal info, basic info, status updates, friend etc become moot and void! Because if ONLY your Friends can see your &quot;Profile&quot;, then what is the point in choosing privacy options for other things? For example, if you end up choosing &quot;friends of friend&quot; can see &quot;my Status Updates&quot; then how is it possible that &quot;only friends&quot; can see your &quot;profile&quot;&#8230;..but &quot;friends of friends&quot; can see your &quot;Status Updates&quot; . Right?</p>
<p>(2) Second:  If I click a small thumbnail picture which appears in my mini-feeds as &quot;My Friend Amy commented on Brad&#039;s picture&quot; or &quot;My friend Amy was tagged in Brads&#039; picture&quot; when Brad is neither my friend nor in my network&#8230;&#8230; then, I can not only see &#039;that&#039; picture of Brad&#8230; but I can see his &#039;whole&#039; personal album! Does this happen because Brad by mistake:</p>
<p>a) Forgot to uncheck the &#039;All of facebook&#039; can see my album box? This is very cunning of FB to do this as by &quot;default&quot; this box is &quot;Checked&quot; and most people don&#039;t even notice this!</p>
<p>OR is it because,</p>
<p>(b) Brad he checked the box &quot;friends of friends&quot; can see this album?</p>
<p>BUT if (b) above is true, then why can&#039;t I go to Brad&#039;s profile and see that album (since I am a friend of friend of Brad&#039;s?). Apparently even though he checked &quot;friend of friend&quot; can see his album, BUT his general profile is hidden and visible only to friends, then WHY am I able to see his album?</p>
<p>Thanks to all in advance,</p>
<p>Betty</p>

	<p>sheena- they used to have that, I think it got to be too much work to approve or deny. you can always have it notify you whenever you&#039;re tagged, and then untag yourself if you wish. the person can then not tag you again in that photo.</p>

	<p>There are still major shortcomings in FB&#039;s privacy controls, including&#8230; the lack of privacy settings for your networks, asymmetric read/write controls for your wall, lack of friend lists and exclusions for your profile, and lack of friend lists for your basic &amp; personal info. Also, in order to simply reply to a Facebook message from a non-friend, you have to give &quot;permission to view your list of friends, as well as your Basic, Work and Education info for one month.&quot;</p>

<p>Athena &#8211; On the news feed when you add an application,there is not a way to stop the very first news feed item. Facebook needs a Global setting in the account area to &quot;disable all application news feeds by default&quot;.  You can however, go to your front page and delete the item yourself after exiting the application. I only let like a couple apps post news feeds.</p>

	<p>You know, I&#8217;d like to ask everyone out there, especially those who are concerned about privacy and ask what kind of society you want to live in?  I&#8217;d like to live in a world where people can know me and know me as a close friend might.  That means they don&#8217;t just see the carefully filtered pre-approved pictures but also those where my head is in the toilet or the bong is to my lips.  That includes my bosses and potential employers.  We are rapidly approaching a day when you will be under surveillance 24/7 and there won&#8217;t be a whole hell of alot you can do about it.  So instead of trying to invent an idealized version of yourself to meet &#8220;their&#8221; standards, I hope you realize we can turn the equation around and redefine &#8220;acceptable behavior&#8221; to mean behavior that we can achieve without the anxious wringing of hands and obsessive deletion of anything that might compromise your shitty job.</p>

	<p>In regards to #9. Avoid Embarrassing Wall Posts, upon examining the wall post configurations within in a profile page (accessed via the Settings icon) and Profile Privacy setting page (Wall Posts section), I am uncertain that these two preferences address different Wall post customizations. The tip states that the first preference allows you to configure who can see posts made by friends, and that the second preference allows you to configure who can post to your Wall. If you click on the Help question mark by the Wall Post section of the Profile Privacy setting page, however, the dialogue box states:</p>
<p>&#8220;Use this control to decide who, upon reaching your profile, can see posts on your Wall made by your friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this is accurate, then both sets of preferences perform the same function—configuring who can see posts made on your Wall. If this is correct, then there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to set permissions for who can post to your Wall beyond the all or nothing checkbox in both preferences.</p>
<p>Can Nick O&#8217;Neill or a reader verify this?</p>

	<p>This is great &#8212; all facebook users should be aware of these.</p>
<p>One thing you didn&#8217;t mention in the application section, though, is that you don&#8217;t need to scan your profile every time you use/visit an app&#8230; just after the first time you&#8217;ve added it.  After you&#8217;ve added it, you can go to your application settings page and say the application is not allowed to post things in your news feed. A commenter above was right, though, there does not seem to be a way to to prevent it before you add the app.</p>

	<p>i know that Excepting = exclude, not counting.<br />
But I&#8217;m SO SO SO confused.</p>
<p>So in a situation, say for setting who can see my list of FRIENDS,&#8230;</p>
<p>For &#8220;Who can see this&#8221;,  I choose &#8220;ONLY FRIENDS&#8221;<br />
and then have people in my &#8220;EXCEPT THESE PEOPLE&#8221;, the people in the excluded group CAN or CANNOT see my Friends list??</p>
<p>If I choose &#8220;NO ONE&#8221; can see my&#8230; say WALLPOSTS.<br />
Are the people in the &#8220;EXCEPT THESE PEOPLE&#8221; list ABLE or NOT ABLE to see my wallpost?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it just be easier if it was clearer &#8220;who CAN see this information&#8221; and &#8220;who CAN NOT see this information&#8221;. or is it just me?!</p>
<p>I rather they had thought first and foremost about our privacy first&#8230; I mean, the users keep the phenomena going. I&#8217;m glad they were able to implement these settings, so for that, thank you!<br />
Thanks for the info also!</p>

<p>First, do a search on Google and find yourself &#8211;I used my  name and region. You may need to keep narrowing the parameters, but your FB page is there on Google! and then you can edit from there&#8211;it takes you right to the search privacy page in FB. </p>

	<p>One other thing to note about privacy on Facebook is that if Facebook adds a new Privacy setting it is alway turned off. So you must go in an activate it. </p>
<p>In Canada this is basically like negative sales. You sign up for a product like a Cell / Mobile Phone and unless you uncheck all the options you end up paying for the highest plan.</p>
<p>This was made illegal a few years back because the banks and mobile phone companies etc were making a killing by selling options to un savvy customers who didn&#039;t know enough to opt out of the services.</p>
<p>So you should go back and check all your settings everynow an then on Facebook to make sure they haven&#039;t changed something so that it is now visible when you thought it wasn&#039;t.</p>

	<p>It seems like &#8220;privacy&#039;&#039; is not the only thing some people want to control.  Rather, we consider Facebook a public presentation of our identity, and we want to look good for the same reason we want to dress well.  Maybe we want to be more playful with our friends, but we don&#039;t want them picking out our wardrobes!</p>
<p>But we sort of do, so how can you control it, have it both ways?  I was a little horrified by my own vanity reading about the setting &#8220;allow only THESE friends to post to your wall,&#039;&#039; thinking, ha I could use that on some people.  But it feels awful to be on the other end of that.  When someone starts expurgating my posts, I&#039;m not so much upset at being deleted as &#8220;you were just wearing my friendship like clothing from the beginning.  ick.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>Secondly, in facebook-privacy-world, the right to see something is often separate from the right to search for it.  I don&#039;t like this because if someone untags a photo, and you see it anyway, you get accused of &#8220;stalking&#039;&#039; them because they are like &#8220;OMG how did you FIND it?!&#039;&#039;  First, what made you think I was looking for it?  The answer is probably &#8220;because I *know* you&#039;re interested in me.&#039;&#039;  Well in that case, what an awful word for expressing interest in your friends!</p>
<p>For a second example, most younger users set all their album privacy to Everyone, Networks, or Friends-of-Friends.  They have to.  I think a more restrictive setting breaks the social process for which they use facebook, because they often go to events with people they&#039;re not facebook-friends with, and after the event they want to (1) see ALL the pictures, (2) request new friends by looking at the photo tags.  if you are not friends with a photo album&#039;s owner, those settings mean you can still see photos of your friends tagged in there, and once you can see a photo of one friend you can see the rest of the album, too.  This way, facebook actually functions like a, well, facebook, putting you in touch with people you remember seeing.  If you want the result, it&#039;s &#8220;awesome, i love facebook,&#039;&#039; and if you don&#039;t, whoever did exactly the same thing is &#8220;stalking&#039;&#039; you.</p>
<p>so, my plea is that everyone learn how to use the privacy settings and stop expecting to have their minds read or for everyone else to use facebook in the same limited way of which they&#039;re capable.  If you want to call someone who knowingly expresses unwanted interest in you a stalker, DO IT, those people are rude!  but trying to stygmatize people who know how to use facebook because you don&#039;t, or you would just rather blame them than try to learn because it&#039;s so much easier, ought to make everyone perceive you as lazy ignorant and unwilling to accept responsibility, as well as rather unkind!</p>
<p>Thirdly, that said it&#039;s actually hard to see what the news feed you&#039;re spewing looks like.  You can break the rules, make a second profile, set it to Unsearchable, and friend your main profile&#8212;then you can login to the second profile to see the news you&#039;re spewing.  but I think it&#039;s against the rules.  and remember even if it were possible to delete things from a news feed after they happen (like how it&#039;s possible to delete them from your wall), which it *isn&#039;t*, it&#039;d be meaningless anyway because you can get an email copy of some parts of the news feed, and email can&#039;t be deleted after it&#039;s sent because email is part of the Old Internet, before women started using it, and &#8220;no deleting&#039;&#039; is how the patriarchy saw fit to design it.</p>
<p>anyway, please take responsibility for your own privacy, or Presentation, or whatever you are trying to accomplish, and don&#039;t blame the people looking at you for what you wore&#8212;that&#039;s my request.</p>

	<p>Great page, thanks for this &#8211; I&#039;ll point some of my more paranoid friends in its direction.</p>
<p>One more point though ,that wasn&#039;t covered.  I haven&#039;t read all the comments, so apologies if someone has already brought this up:  Applications that seem harmless can act as data miners and, as I understand it, can access your friends details as well.</p>
<p>So, while I may not have chosen to add the &quot;Send underwater lovehearts&quot; application, it can nevertheless access certain aspects of my information.</p>
<p>This can be remedied by blocking your information in the settings described in the post or by blocking the application entirely.  The latter also means if other friends invite you to the application (and I&#039;ve had over a dozen invites for the same application in one day before) you don&#039;t get the same invites popping up again and again and again.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

	<p>In tip #6 you mention changing the privacy setting for your &quot;Basic info.&quot;  I would like to hide my relationship status from everyone except for close friends &#8212; which I have all in one &quot;friend group.&quot;  However, not only is there no way to only control the setting for relationship status.. there is also no option under the &quot;basic info&quot; category to allow only &quot;some friends&quot; access to your basic info.</p>
<p>Most other categories have a &quot;some friends&quot; option.  I guess it&#039;s because &quot;basic info&quot; seems like an essential category that you shouldn&#039;t want to block too many people from.  Instead of being able to choose the select few you want to be able to see it; instead you have to single out those people who you con&#039;t want to see it.. it allows you to block people one by one .. but doesn&#039;t give you the option to block everybody.</p>

<p>note: Your section &#039;Control Who Can Post to Your Wall&#039; isn&#039;t entirely correct though &#8212; you can prevent everyone from posting, but not individual friends it seems.  You can hide your wall from individuals but not simply make it &quot;read only&quot; for specific friends.</p>

	<p>Thank you very much for writing and posting this resource.  However, I hope that readers do not think that this presents every conceivable way that your privacy can be compromised on facebook.</p>
<p>One point you do NOT mention is one that caught me unaware recently: </p>
<p>Anytime you interact with a &quot;random&quot; non-friend (for example, a friend of a friend whose posted photo of your friend you comment on, or a wannabe friend whose friend invite you reply to with &quot;Sorry, you must have me confused with&#8230;&quot;), you are basically giving the &quot;random&quot; permission to view your profile **as if they were your friend** for 30 days!  A random non-friend whose note I had commented on started commenting on my photos. Creepy!</p>

	<p>I don&#039;t have the &quot;Create a public search listing&quot; option available to me either, as some others mentioned. I remember that option though, and remember that I had mine unchecked. I also unchecked that option when setting up privacy features for someone else&#039;s account. Neither of our names nor Facebook listings come up when I type our respective names into Google. My guess is, it worked for us. Don&#039;t know what to tell the people who can&#039;t find this listed for them, though. Maybe Facebook got rid of it, or placed it somewhere else? (If we&#039;re going to advocate that FB do something, let&#039;s make the next campaign about putting all relevant privacy/account/search/profile, etc. settings in one place, instead of making us all jump through hoops to try to figure this out. It can be very daunting for the newly-initiated FB user.)</p>

	<p>Anna (2/17/09 @ 11:19PM) &#8211; It&#039;s very easy to do what you&#039;re asking. When you&#039;re in FB, look in the lower right corner of your screen.  You will see a little person icon with a green dot next to it.  Left click this icon, then click &quot;go offline&quot;.  You will now see a red dot instead of green, and this means you will appear as offline to all your friends whenever you are on FB.</p>

	<p>Yes, did FB change some of these lately?  The box to disallow Google from indexing was not available to me.  Neither was custom control over only letting some friends see my wall postings, or only letting some friends see my friends list.  I couldn&#039;t manage either of these using custom friend groups.  Clarification of this post would be appreciated if FB has changed their options.</p>

	<p>Thanks for this info.  I had pictures of a friend&#039;s child I wanted to share with them and others that were there when they were taken who are also on FB, but knew the parents didn&#039;t like all and sundry seeing photos of their baby.  I used the privacy settings for photos and it was brilliant and would use it again.  Handy to have these hints and tips provided, as sometimes we don&#039;t have the time to figure it out but want extra security and privacy and just use Facebook to keep in touch with real friends and socialise with them! For others they can ignore it and be humiliated without their knowing it! We can all make the choice, and that&#039;s what I like.</p>

	<p>Wow&#8230;seriously? Turning off the sharing functions with friends on Facebook? Really? Geeze&#8230;get over yourself:</p>
<p>1) Most people are NOT into you&#8230;because you&#039;re *gasp* just not that special.</p>
<p>2) People who do care, will pay attention, and Facebook is simply a communications tool to enable that. If you&#039;re trying to hide, then what the heck are you doing on Facebook in the first place?</p>
<p>3) If you&#039;re foolish-enough to think privacy still exists, then you obviously have no idea the extent of personal information which exists in public records&#8230;nor the ease at which many other semi-private records are accessed daily.</p>
<p>4) If you&#039;re doing something that&#039;ll end a meaningful long-term relationship, or end a job, have you ever considered&#8230;umm&#8230;not doing it?! Seriously&#8230;how difficult is that concept?</p>
<p>5) For those in that category consisting of some fraction of 1%, whom have been stalked, raped, or otherwise attacked, injured, or even killed through online-linked info/activity. You (they) have my sympathy; I&#039;ve been on the receiving end of some pretty terrible abuse myself. While none was linked with online activity&#8230;it sucks just as much&#8230; Though, I&#039;m not allowing an individual&#039;s screwed-up sense of morality to control my life, or my decisions&#8230;and they know it&#8230; Stop living in fear.</p>

	<p>A useful setting for more serious privacy matters that didn&#039;t get mentioned is the &quot;Block List&quot;.  I didn&#039;t know about many of these security measures, this is a great post, but Block List works well to prevent specific people from finding you.  People can regularly send you messages even after you have unfriended them, but putting them on the Block List, in Privacy Settings, makes you unfindable for them on facebook- you do not exist.  You just type their name in a box.  Simpler than hiding from everyone, good for avoiding harassment.</p>

	<p>agreed that Facebook has removed the option to remove ourselves from google search.</p>
<p>i joined facebook right around new year&#039;s day 2009, and i have never seen the option. just looked for it and cannot find it anywhere.</p>
<p>and i can find myself all quick like with a google search. it goes to a page that says my name and has the default non-picture facebook avatar and no further information.</p>
<p>looks like facebook wants to advertise itself with our presence and thinks it can do so no matter what we think, i.e., &quot;joe blow is on facebook!&quot; they are going to say through the google regardless of our wishes.</p>

	<p>As I tried to implement #10 Keep Your Friendships Private, I could not find an obvious way to prevent friends from seeing other friends. So I created a Friend List called &quot;all friends added&quot; and changed the setting for &quot;Friends&quot; on the &quot;Profile Privacy&quot; page to Customize it to &quot;Only Friends&quot; Except These People: &quot;all friends added&quot; which I hope does the trick.</p>

I wasn&#8217;t aware of this until a couple of friends mentioned it to me. Not only did it appear on my contact info, it was also part of the news feed on my profile page. I have since removed both- one by modifying a privacy setting, the other I had to manually delete.</p>

	<p>I&acute;m thinking about deleting my account&#8230; but it&acute;s become a catch-22 situation. Why? I&acute;d like to be free of the whole thing, which I now only use to keep in touch with friends and dislike the whole curtain-twitching element of it, but I am reluctant to sign off completely as I would like to know how I&acute;m being represented online amongst all my acquaintances (photos uploaded, comments, etc). All those who&acute;ve already posted DO have a facebook presence, even if they don&acute;t sign in and see it. You know that party you went to last weekend? Those photos your friend took are likely on facebook already!</p>

	<p>Regarding the multiple friends lists.  If you have the same person on two or more lists and have different privacy settings for the various friends lists, does FB keep the settings separately?  For example, say you have your wife on both the Family friends list and a Church friends list. If you wish to have a more inclusive amount of information on the Family list, does putting your wife on both lists open up the more inclusive set of information to the members of the Church list?</p>

	<p>How about creating a Friend List where the people on the list are not allowed to see posts from the other people in the same list. An example would maybe be a list of girls you are dating, or maybe competing clients. That seems like a pretty useful feature.</p>

<p>It&#039;s true though, even if you don&#039;t use facebook your privacy is at risk: many people have no discretion over the pictures they post or who is in them. I&#039;ve heard stories of non-facebook users being &quot;caught out&quot; by users who saw them in other people&#039;s pictures.  The best way to avoid embarrassing disclosures is simply to avoid the situation in the first place.</p>

<p>And in response to jb&#039;s post on 2/5 &#8212; you can remove the &quot;you became friends with&#8230;&quot; by going to Privacy settings, News feed and wall, and uncheck the &quot;Add a friend&quot; box.</p>

	<p>I haven&#039;t read through all the comments, so if someone&#039;s already mentioned this I apologize: Being able to control your privacy to such degrees is great &#8212; but my problem is when people act like you HAVE to limit your exposure.  For example, you might friend somebody and they complain that they are seeing all your status updates, pictures, application news feeds, etc. and suggest that you adjust your settings so that they (and everyone else, they claim) don&#039;t have to be bothered by your trivial life details.  But privacy settings are for the USER, not for the convenience of the user&#039;s friends or networks.  If someone is not interested in seeing a bunch of frivolous news feeds, THEY need to adjust their news feed settings so that they don&#039;t have to see thing they don&#039;t want to see.</p>

	<p>Thanks for the info!  I&#039;m going to use all these tips.</p>
<p>What bugs me is that someone can just randomly take a pic of you, and stick it on thier facebook.  This guy I had just met sent me a friend request, and I accepted.  The next day, a tagged pic of me popped up that he apparentally took with his phone without me knowing.  I had just met him that night&#8230;.creepy!  The pic wasn&#039;t inappropriate, but it was VERY unflattering.  I deleted the tag so at least people who I haven&#039;t seen since high school that are on my friend list wouldn&#039;t see such a gross pic of me!</p>
<p>What still bothers me though, is that pic is still on his profile and there is nothing I can do about that.  I think its sick that someone can &quot;sneak&quot; a pic of you and then just post it on their site.  If I were not on Facebook, I never would have even known he took a pic of me.  Now at least I know to stay away from where the creepy guy with the camera is&#8230;&#8230;ugh!</p>

	<p>I agree that a lot of this should be activated by default. In lieu of that, there should be a tiered system of friending someone. You should be able to assign levels of access to people when you approve them. &quot;Confirm as friend&quot; &quot;Confirm as acquaintance&quot; &quot;Confirm as co-worker&quot; &quot;Confirm as relative,&quot; etc. There would be a different level of privacy with each and you&#039;d be able to apply them on an individual basis at the click of one button. (To keep everyone egos soothed, no matter which you choose the news feed would still read &quot;X is now friends with Y.&quot;</p>

	<p>just an fyi &#8211; not sure if he covered it, as this is a long article and I just skimmed it.. but there is a privacy feature to control overall privacy of the entire photo album section and fb and there is a privacy control feature for each photo album.</p>
<p>Also, every application has it&#039;s own privacy control &#8211; For example, if you want Friend A to see your bumper stickers but not CoWorker B, then you can prevent CoWorker B from seeing it, as well as any other application or &#039;box&#039; you have on your page.</p>
<p>In respose to Hannah above:   &quot;No Networks&quot; means people in your network that you are NOT friends with cannot see the pictures.  If you want to limit it further you will have to put certain friends from the network in their own group and then block them</p>

	<p>Thanks for the detailed guide to Facebook privacy. While most of these settings are obvious thru a quick browse of the privacy settings page, I hadn&#039;t thought about making separate friend&#039;s lists and assigning different privacy settings to each of them.</p>

	<p>The public search only shows up if under search availability, you have it set to everyone.  Otherwise, the option is not there.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t like it that if a friend comments on a picture of mine, all of their friends can now see my pictures.  Any way to change this?</p>

	<p>This seems somewhat paranoid to me. Do you really have that much to hide (and is your information in that much demand)? I find some use for two or three of these tips. The others might be useful if I were either a secret agent or having multiple affairs.</p>

<p>1) &quot;if you don&rsquo;t want to share it, the DON&rsquo;T JOIN&quot; &#8211; actually, not true and that&acute;s the problem (see my previous comment)</p>
<p>2) Why should you have to moderate your (perfectly legal) behaviour like having a drink with friends or hanging out with the people you want to just because of the potential privacy issues of a big-business social networking site? Sorry, is your life lived primarily via the internet or in your body??</p>
<p>3) In the case of your boss firing you for the reason that he saw a picture of you drunk at a party, then, yes, maybe you could sue him. However, in the likely event that he doesn&acute;t specify that as the reason when firing you, then I guess you can&acute;t&#8230;</p>
<p>4) It&acute;s unlawful.</p>

On number 9, &quot;Avoid Embarrassing Wall Posts&quot;, both options, whether I set it in my profile wall setting or profile privacy setting, if I exclude a person, then that person can neither see any walls posts nor write on my wall.  I was hoping if anybody can tell me if there was a way to stop someone from seeing wall posts made by others but still be able to write to my wall? It&#039;s really important.</p>

	<p>ah, i found the answer about why we can&#039;t block google:</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search engine &quot;crawlers&quot; (e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these engines to personal information beyond your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of wall postings).</p>
<p>they won&#039;t allow them complete access to our information, but they will grant them access to our name, our friends, or whatever else you want displayed when someone finds you in a facebook search.</p>

<p>The first one, might be of interest to your Mom, Nick.</p>
<p>1. At the very bottom right hand corner is a silhouette of a little man with a coloured dot beside it. Click on it to make it red and it hides the fact that you are online making you appear as offline.  Green shows you are online.</p>
<p>2. On your &#039;Home&#039; page in the &#039;News Ffeed&#039; section going to the very bottom there&#039;s a note saying &#039;Options for News Feed&#039;. Click on that and it displays sliders that you can drag to control the amount of news feeds that you receive from your different friends.</p>

	<p>If I have myself blocked from search results, can my friend&#039;s friends still see me in their friend lists?</p>
<p>I have every privacy setting on the most private secure setting. And Facebook does not even have my real name in my account. Still I would like to know if I am visible on others&#039; friend lists if I have blocked myself from search.</p>
<p>Does anyone know? Much appreciated.</p>

	<p>Like others have said, FB, MySpace, Twitter, etc., create privacy concerns and are a waste of time. Spend real time with the real people in your life.  Really, what a self-important lot we&#039;ve become. Most don&#039;t care what you are doing. For those that do, how about actually communicating via phone or in person? Now there&#039;s a revolutionary idea! I don&#039;t see these services as bringing people together. They are actually more a way to keep people at a distance. Think about it.</p>

	<p>hi,<br />
any ideas how to block someone who has already blocked you &#8211; I don&#8217;t want him to be able to search me &#8211; but as he has blocked me his name doesn&#8217;t come up in the search list when you are on the block user page. This seems like a real oversight.</p>

	<p>Some one PLEASE help me! I performed a function on my facebook that has messed up my pictures. I was trying to figure out a way to block certain photos from being viewed (photos I&#039;d been tagged in, it&#039;s nice to finally know how!), and now my photos seem to be randomly blocked from view. This occurs in my tagged photos, my photo albums and other peoples photos that I try to view on their sites. It seems quite random and it drives me nuts! I can view all photos on my facebook on other computers. It just seems to be affecting my computer alone. I don&#039;t know how to fix it and it is really disheartening. Here is the function that has ruined my facebook life!</p>
<p>-I right clicked on a photo that I had been tagged in on my facebook.</p>
<p>-scrolled down and clicked </p>
<p>Block Images from photos-d.ll.fac&#8230;</p>
<p>Now my pics are all messed up and I am no computer whiz. Please help. I want to see photos of me, my family, and my friends!</p>

	<p>Excuse me for thinking reasonably, but I don&#039;t understand why on earth anyone would want to use such an intrusive system that is more likely to have detrimental effects in your life if you miss out one tick on one of the thousands little things that pop on your screen? Looks like you need a manual to make safe use of that network and again you may always miss something! </p>
<p>What&#039;s wrong in using a less intruding network or none at all? We are totally unaware that we becoming pray of the few and some of us love it and ask for more. Its pathetic to say the least.</p>

	<p>Facebook&#039;s default privacy settings pathetically remain in the dark ages when the only people on Facebook  were college students who all knew one another, kind of. The point being, Facebook&#039;s default privacy settings are frighteningly lax and totally inappropriate for the internet age of social networking. Bare in mind, this thing is being run by a kid who thinks he&#039;s managing a virtual country populated by virtual citizens in a video game. It&#039;s time for the Facebook world of account holders, you/us/them to demand that Mark Zukerberg and his kid  development team wake up restructure the site&#039;s default privacy settings to &quot;show nothing to no one&quot; and restructure site&#039;s convoluted lack of transparency to the privacy control settings so that the only information that shows to anyone is only what the account holder has explicitly allowed! Would you like me to post some links  to some popular celebrities friend lists? None of whom I&#039;m sure are even aware that a list of all their personal friends are currently being published ALL OVER THE GLOBE.</p>

	<p>I only read about 50 of these so not sure if anyone addressed this, but: Is there any way to keep your &quot;friends&quot; from knowing when you are on Facebook? (Down at the bottom right hand corner where it lists how many of your friends are online and then tells you who.) I don&#039;t necessarily want everyone to know when I am online and have even had people make comments about the frequency and what time of day I was on FB. Also when I am trying to post, people cut in on you to &quot;chat&quot;.</p>

	<p>Great article though I already figured out all the above the other night on my own, would&#8217;ve been helpful had I seen this post first. Either way, this is yet another reason why I am not a fan of Facebook.</p>
<p>I prefer Myspace for more reason than one but security concerns have always been an issue of mine with Facebook. I got family members who are uploading pictures of me when I was a wee-one, which I don&#8217;t mind if strangers see but when those pictures are posted on my profile for anyone to see&#8230; That bothers me. Additionally, RSVPing to Events, I don&#8217;t need everyone to know what I&#8217;m doing and I have yet to figure out how to disable that. </p>
<p>All in all, Facebook is lame and it&#8217;s now no fun at all. I had to disable Wall Posts and the photo tagging and can&#8217;t RSVP to events as I don&#8217;t need everyone I know knowing my life.</p>

<p>         People simply need to think 1rst &amp; think an action thru prior to taking it. One needs to keep one&#039;s priorities in perspective. When unsure of the best route to take, ask someone. With so many means of communication available to us now, it seems people just want to save time &amp; take short-cuts. There are none. A moment of precaution can save months of frustration.

<p>Is there a way to make your &quot;Personal Information&quot; under the Info Page visible to users you have sent &quot;Add Requests&quot;,because when you change the settings under the Privacy -&gt; Profile -&gt; Personal Info .. it is such that either you make it visible for even those who are not your friends/everyone or you make it strictly for &quot;only friends&quot;.So,is there a way?</p>

<p>I share the interest to eliminate mundane news feed postings. I don&#039;t mind my friends posting to my WALL because they are polite in direct correspondence. What I want to eliminate is having to slog through other people&#039;s news feeds&#8211;specific people who post 15-20 updates in one day. I enjoyed facebook before, Now I have a friend who&#039;s pushing everyone else off my page!!</p>

	<p>My account was disabled because I was requesting friend data too often. I had Snap2Face configured to update every 5 minutes. I asked Facebook to reactivate my account and they finally did after 5 days. Here is the email I received from Facebook after the reactivation:</p>
<p>Your account has been reactivated. Please significantly slow down the rate at which you browse Facebook, or your account may be disabled again. We would recommend that you discontinue the use of the Snap2Face application as it appears to be flagging your account as abusive. Please notify the developers of this application that this problem has occurred. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>Basically, Snap2Face works great, just don&#039;t configure it for 5 minute updates or they will think you&#039;re a spammer.</p>
<p>By the way, Facebook deactivated my account without warning. It worked fine one day, but I was unable to login the next. They did not even send me an email to explain why.myaccount name is samadtokonamin.my mail <a href="mailto:samadtokon@yahoo.com.please">samadtokon@yahoo.com.please</a> active my account.</p>

	<p>When I go to Facebook, I don&#8217;t always want my friends to know I&#8217;m there. Sometimes I just want to check something quickly and get back out. But many times I get chatters that want to carry on long drawn out conversations with me and I don&#8217;t want to be rude. </p>

	<p>Hello everyone I was wondering if your school can watch what you do on Facebook if your not on there network. Also I was wondering if your school is aloud to delete your facebook if your not 13 and in high school. And most of all what can your school do for stuff that happens on facebook if your not on there network</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

	<p>I wish there was a way to choose which friend groups could see certain wall posts. Like in Livejournal you can make your post visible to no one (private), friends only (including different filtered lists of friends), or public. The way it is now you can exclude a friend group from seeing your wall posts, but then they can&#8217;t post anything either.</p>

	<p>dreamluverz, facebook removed that slider when they updated the site earlier this spring.  Your only choices on the news feed (home) page now are to move your cursor over to the right and then to hide a specific person or to hide the application (e.g., quiz or game) that they just used.  You can&#039;t opt for &quot;show less,&quot; either.  It&#039;s either all visible or all seen for the person/app &#8212; and it stinks!</p>

	<p>Turning off the view friends function is probably the best advise. You can make your profile water tight by going through and doing all that was recommended here. But if you have view friends visible, and one of your friends isn&#8217;t so tight with their privacy, any interactions you have with that person will be visible (on their profile) Photos they tagged or took of you, posts you made to their wall etc.. For example it&#8217;s no good setting your privacy to the max then going and saying something bad about someone or your workplace to one of your friends (the one with the public profile). And if people do really want to be private why do they want to let everyone know who they are friends with anyway. If a person really wanted to find out about someone well they&#8217;ve suddenly got this nice long list of their contacts names and their mug shots. Very handy if you spot one of these people at a party, you could get to chatting and slowly move the conversation to the person you&#8217;re curios about. Who needs facebook, everyone love gossip don&#8217;t they.</p>

But a week ago I noticed that reappeared his comment to our common friends&#039; status, and photos, and activities in general (I am sure I am still blocked). I can see only this comment, but not what he write on the wall of common friends (and obviusly I still can&#039;t find his profile anywhere. the comments appeare with the anonymous blue facebook photo and I cannot click on his name). How is it possible? And if I block someone, this person will ever be able to see my comments?</p>

<p>I want to work out why/how it is that my BF&#039;s profile info says he has &quot;19&quot; friends but only 18 show up when counted ie one is hidden&#8230; did he somehow manage to hide just one friend or has that friend somehow hidden themselves (from me)? When I search for that person by name I can find them&#8230; which I think suggests they have not blocked me&#8230;but my friend does not show up as our mutual friend. I need to work out who did what to achieve this&#8230; for obvious reasons.  Thanks.</p>

	<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thanks for good info. However, I don&#039;t find this to be true (and I REALLY want to find a way to do this):</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Control Who Can Post to Your Wall</p>
<p>In addition to controlling who can view wall postings published by your friends, you also want to control which friends can post on your wall. If you visit the Profile Privacy settings page, there is a section labeled &ldquo;Wall Posts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From this area you can completely disable your friends&rsquo; ability to post on your wall. You can also select specific friend lists that can post on your wall. Personally, I don&rsquo;t really care who can post on my wall but I can understand the need to control who can see those wall postings. If you want to limit who can post wall posts on your profile, this is where you can do it.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>FB is itself confusing on this&#8211;there is the check &quot;Friends may post to my Wall&quot; BUT when you go to customize this, it says &quot;Who Can See This?&quot; And then if you add a name, that person, ironically, can&#039;t SEE posts to your wall (according to &quot;Who Can See This?&quot;), but they can still post there themselves! Or at least this is the way it appears&#8230;am I missing something? The wording is really hard to decipher.</p>
<p>Clarification would be great!</p>

<p>I agree with the last post: I can&#039;t find a way to differentiate between who can post to my wall and who can read others&#039; posts on my wall. Is there one? How?</p>
<p>Also, I did not find any way to restrict my friends so nobody sees them. At the least it always shows them to my friends. Am I missing something?</p>

	<p>The last part of your article is not correct. The privacy profile for who can see your friends list did not allow me to customize so that only some friend lists can see my friends lists. or is there a way to turn on this function?</p>

	<p>It&#039;s important to understand that pictures are NEVER private, no matter what setting you choose.  Even if the privacy settings are set to &quot;only friends&quot; or a specific group, once any of your friends makes a comment on one of your photos, that photo becomes public.  That&#039;s because a line goes in your friend&#039;s News Feed that says &quot;John Smith commented on Jane Doe&#039;s PHOTO&quot;.  Any of John Doe&#039;s friends can now click on the word Photo and see the picture AND the ENTIRE album.  If he has 2000 friends, all of them can see the whole album.  I think this should be made clear in the article.</p>

	<p>thanks SO much for posting this.  i had about 1/2 of these suggestions set as you suggested, but thanks to you, i made even more changes to keep me as private as possible.</p>
<p>one thing i&#039;d really like to see facebook change is the stupid notifications about applications i dont even use. why isnt there a way to stop them from being posted in the notifications and leave that area for &quot;actual&quot; notifications, ie: someone posted to my wall or commented on a picture, et al?  thats the BIGGEST gripe i have with FB.</p>

	<p>The privacy settings allow you to exclude individuals or lists. It would be nice if you had the option to just allow certain individuals or lists. For example, if you have 10 lists and you only want family to see an album, you have to exclude 9 groups rather than just include 1.</p>

	<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I think there&#039;s a big problem with facebook, especially when you CHANGE your privacy sittings. For example, I&#039;ve been keeping my &quot;status and links&quot; for selected friends, but I want this for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Now, if I change my privacy sittings to let more people see my status updates this means they can go to my profile and see the older statuses I didn&#039;t want them to see.</p>
<p>I think this is a really big problem.. any solutions?</p>
<p>Plus, have you any idea when the twitter-like version of facebook is gonna be available for public? &#039;cause I think that might solve this, right?</p>

	<p>Thanks for the suggestions. What would be REALLY useful is an option to &#039;see ourselves as others see us&#039;, to check the settings. So, for example, in each group there could be a&#039;visibility&#039; button. Click on that and you can see what the group can see about you. Then you would know for sure you&#039;d not forgotten to protect something.</p>

He considers all of a person&#039;s friends to be representative of that person, so if he doesn&#039;t like their friends, he won&#039;t hire them.</p>

	<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Firstly thanks for the post, most useful. </p>
<p>After reading this post, I tried to create a list of companies and &quot;fan&quot; pages that I have added to my profile, and tried to ban them from accessing any information, and it doesn&#039;t seem to work. It raised a question, hope someone knows the answer. </p>
<p>When facebook was changed months ago, they announced that all &quot;fan&quot; pages and companies having their profiles and added to your list of friends will appear on your wall with their posts. </p>
<p>My question is does this mean that the creator of that company account/fan page has access to all my pictures and data like a friend does? </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>If your professional life needs to be firewalled so completely from everything and anything that goes on in your personal life &#8212; well, first, you may want to consider that your job ain&#039;t all that &#8212; then maybe you shouldn&#039;t be mixing the two things on a SOCIAL NETWORKING Web site.</p>

<p>Yes- it&#039;s true for all of you that feel the need to let everyone in on your little &quot;secret&quot;- you can save your privacy by not using FB in the first place.  But seriously- don&#039;t come knocking on the door of people trying to help just to spill your suggestions!  That&#039;s your choice- good for you for sticking to it, but don&#039;t make a big deal about it!  This is our choice to use it and if we want to find information from people like Nick here on trying to take extra precautions than so be it! Let it along already!!</p>

	<p>Regarding Sam&#039;s question about friends who post links to your photo albums, this was bothering me as well and I couldn&#039;t find an answer anywhere, but have now tested it out for myself &#8211; </p>
<p>If your albums are set to &#039;friends only&#039;, even if someone posts a link to them their friends will be unable to see the link, (unless they&#039;re also friends with you obviously)and the notification of the link will not appear in their news feeds at all. Try and find one of your friends with a lot of links, note how many links it says there are on their profile, then click into the links and see how many you can actually view &#8211; for example you might be able to see only 8 out of 10 total links &#8211; that&#039;s because 2 of the links are to albums that someone has set to &#039;friends only&#039;.</p>
<p>Someone else asked about friends of friends seeing photos that you have tagged a friend in. Again if your album is definately set to &#039;friends only&#039; even if you tag a friend, their friends will not see that photo in your friend&#039;s &#039;Photos of &#8230;.&#039; section. That&#039;s why some friends profiles may say &#039;view photos of&#8230;(100)&#039; but when you click in to view the photos, the number you can view is actually less because some of the photos are from restricted albums.</p>

	<p>i kind of disagree with point #2 i.e. removing yourself from facebook results completely. it will be pointless to join facebook if you want to shell yourself from everyone. plus, the whole thing that makes facebook great is the ability for long lost friends and current friends that you might not have seen in a long time to be able to find you. i found so many old friends from 20+ years ago that i would have otherwise forgotten by them searching for me. </p>
<p>i agree about certain amount of privacy but not putting a complete shell around yourself. if ultra privacy is your biggest fear, then one shouldn&#039;t be joining a social networking app like facebook.</p>

Here&#039;s the 1st paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;Privacy advocates have long warned that users of Facebook and other social networks who seek amusement from quizzes like &quot;What Simpsons Character Are You?&quot; might be mortified by the way creators of such applications can access and potentially &quot;scrape&quot; personal information &mdash; not just about the quiz-takers, but their friends as well.&quot;</p>
<p>My advice: don&#039;t take these quizes, don&#039;t play these games, don&#039;t take thise polls. There are so many other ways to amuse yourself!</p>

	<p>I have to agree with one poster, if you want to remain completely private then you have to stop or never use social networking sites. And no matter what anyone says you cant completely control how you show up in search engines and believe me you do. If you have a myspace, facebook, twitter, etc. profile, blog, website you will be in the search engines. If you are self employed, in business for yourself and have any kind of web presence you&#039;ll be in linked in, zoom info, D&amp;B, even some chamber of commerce websites. Privacy is a thing of the past basically.</p>
<p>Personally I like the web presence for professional and hobby reasons.</p>
<p>BUt if you don&#039;t then it&#039;s time to get off the internet.</p>

	<p>I have all those settings applied, but there are still holes.  With items posted to the Home Page or the Highlights (where your friends have commented on their friends pics) and within your photo albums, there is the ability to Share.  Here you can Share your friends, and their friends private pictures with any of your friends, or post it to your own profile for all your friends to see.  </p>
<p>Be careful who you give access to this information that can be shared out, until these privacy setting are tightened up!</p>

I had de-activated my FB account but would like to go back without the ex-friend knowing. If I block her, will my name show up in the mutual friend&#039;s list of friends enabling the ex-friend to see that I&#039;m back on FB?(I hope that makes sense.)</p>

<p>I notice on certain friends&#039; profiles, I can only see their activity on their wall (when they comment on pictures or statuses, etc.) when that activity is done with a mutual friend. If they comment on a photo of someone who isn&#039;t a mutual friend, I won&#039;t see it on their wall.</p>

	<p>There are detailed answers to just about any question under the &quot;Help&quot; section (look at the bottom right corner of most pages). Then search and read the topics/answers provided by Facebook (I would not recommend using the interactive part of the Help section&#8230;it&#039;s mostly people asking questions over and over again that have already been answered&#8230;and then expecting that FB will contact them directly to answer their question). </p>

	<p>Hello, I could not find a solution to my problem or to be more precise only a confusing one. </p>
<p>My problem: I restricted the visibility of my wall at the privacy setting so that only my friends can see my wall.</p>
<p>Problem: I tested it and still people who are not my friends can see my wall.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Now I read that in the official help:</p>
<p>&quot;My privacy settings restrict somebody from seeing my Wall posts, but the Wall still displays when I view my account as that person.</p>
<p>When you restrict someone from seeing your Wall posts, they will still be able to see posts that you make, comments on those posts, and Recent Activity stories that appear on your Wall.&quot;</p>
<p>Eh&#8230;when I restrict somebody they will still be able to see it?</p>
<p>To be honest I don&#039;t get it at all, maybe somebody can explain that to me.</p>
<p>My goal: My wall should dissapear for people who are not my friends</p>

	<p>Could you please educate me on how to protect my photos from facebook itself? There is a rumour making the rounds that your photos -though private to you -can and will be utilized -printed published by facebook at any time. Is this true? And how can I insure that my photos are never used by facebook?</p>

	<p>Has anyone noticed that Facebook privacy settings aren&#039;t working properly anymore? I have my profile set so people can only send me a message but not befriend me. Still I&#039;ve been getting alerts saying people have added me as a friend regardless.</p>

	<p>Rrr.  I have a bunch of lists set up mainly so I can check up on the newsfeeds from family, friends, etc. separately.  Problem is, it doesn&#039;t work.  There are people who are not on my &quot;Bestest Buddies&quot; list whose posts continue to show up in the newsfeed.  Similarly, there are people on the list whose posts I am missing (I can go to their profile page and see that they&#039;ve been posting).  Sometimes I don&#039;t know why I bother with facebook.</p>

	<p>I&#039;ve noticed that the setting for who can see your friends does not work. I have mine set to only friends. I would expect then that NO ONE can see my list of friends unless they are already my friend. </p>
<p>I tested with an account that is not my friend. Though they cannot seem my profile information- they can see my friends and use those links to get to accounts of friends that are not tightened down and view any information I have with that person.  Yes- its a risk that anyone could find said unsecure friend- but being able to see my friends list pretty much tells them exactly who to look for.  </p>

	<p>Why can&#039;t there be a setting to block certain friends from being able to see a wall posting on your profile.  Not the whole wall, just a specific posting.  i.e. a funny joke which might not be so funny to your mom or your little sister.  The only options we have right now is to either risk offending them or not posting it at all.</p>

	<p>Thank you for this. You confirmed what I wanted to be certain of, by changing the search features I can&#039;t be found by others. </p>
<p>Another note, under the privacy settings. The block list. If there is someone you don&#039;t want to be able to find you at all, and you have their email address (especially the one associated with their account) you can block that person. They wont be able to find you if they search for you, they can&#039;t see any part of your account at all. A very important feature to be aware of.</p>

<p>When my friends leave comments on my Profile photos, it appears in my friend&#039;s wall and his friends (who are not mine) can see it (e.g. Joe made a comment on Dave&#039;s photo).

	<p>Dear Nick,<br />
your article is really great, but I have one question, kind of similar to jova&#8217;s.<br />
I am not on Facebook and I have never been (or any other social network for that matter) but still my friends, who are on facebook, use photos of me and leave them there for everyone to see. Is there anything I can do about it? If I wanted my photos on internet, I&#8217;d put them there myself.<br />

	<p>I have followed all the rules of privacy and I understand the advantages/disadvantages of FB, but there is one thing I couldn&#8217;t achieve: ** In regards to pictures tagged of me, I customized it as viewed ONLY by me, just because the old pics from my old firends, I don&#8217;t want them visible to everyone. But my tagged pics from my today&#8217;s friends, I want them visible, abd since they belong to the my &#8220;tagged by friends&#8221; album, NONE of them are visible to others.  There is something I can do to solve this issue? Can I go to that albun and change settings pic by pic? therefore I&#8217;ll be controling what pics tagged of me could go visible and which one no.

	<p>A lot of people are posting saying, essentially, that you should avoid Facebook because of all the privacy issues, (which I don&#8217;t agree with &#8230; Facebook has value for me).</p>
<p>Others post, saying they wish they could control this or that. Followups typically say something like &#8220;you can already do that, by doing this or that.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that reply comes with information on how to make such a setting, that&#8217;s fine and I welcome such posts.</p>
<p>But, if the reply also says something along the line of &#8220;it&#8217;s easy, just do this&#8221; and &#8220;Facebook already provides a way to control your privacy&#8221; I have to disagree. This page is long, and it&#8217;s long for a reason. Nor is it totally comprehensive, and that&#8217;s not the fault of the author.</p>
<p>The fact is it&#8217;s very difficult to navigate and comprehend all the possible privacy settings, Facebook&#8217;s defaults are oriented toward marketing information which is the road to profitability for Facebook itself, and you need to spend a great deal of time to set your account in a way that is right for you.</p>
<p>It took me more than an hour to dig through all the necessary privacy settings on Facebook; thankfully I don&#8217;t have many apps, or it probably would take 2 hours. I don&#8217;t think Facebook does a good job of transparency and they clearly do a poor job of making privacy settings easy.</p>
<p>Whatever you can and can&#8217;t do, regarding privacy settings, it&#8217;s definitely NOT easy. It&#8217;s often available, but without an article like this, for most people, it would be essentially impossible.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t good enough. Facebook needs to step up and clear some hurdles.</p>

<p>I thought this way for a while until I found out through friends that pictures of me were appearing on facebook anyway. Because I didn&#8217;t have an account, some idiot friends/acquaintances of mine were tagging my full name on picctures, but I had no idea of this. An overseas visitor even uploaded pictures of the outside of my house, featuring my car, dog etc. which I obviously don&#8217;t want online. Because I didn&#8217;t have facebook I wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;d joined earlier I would have been a) tagged in pictures properly, thereby giving myself the option to remove the tag and b) seen when friends uploaded pictures, thereby giving me the option to ask them to remove them.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s actually safer to have an account under your real name because then you have much more control over what is being uploaded! If you log on daily you can get things removed pretty quickly, either by untagging yourself (they can&#8217;t re-tag you) or by simply asking your friends to remove pics (and unless your friends are jerks, they will).</p>
<p>Without an account it is MUCH harder. When I finally joined I had to go through years&#8217; worth of old albums and point out to friends all the places where I wanted my name and/or image removed! Who knows who could have seen them?!</p>

<p>I notice that when looking through other people&#039;s friends list, some will give the person&#039;s name only, some will give their name and city, and others will give the person&#039;s name, city and/or their most recent wall post.  </p>

I just wish there was a way people could not steal your photos, upload them into their Computer &amp; post them in their albums as if they were the ones that took the photos. I know that if you could see it they could copy it. This is sad because the actual photographers are not getting any credit for it. Any ideas?</p>

	<p>I didn&#039;t consider until recently, that using my child&#039;s photo as my profile pick could be dangerous!  I know, stupid me&#8230;.. but you often just don&#039;t consider what the sickoes out there do!  A warning to all those proud parents out there&#8230;. a friend of a friend was propositioned on how handsom their child is and what was their name etc&#8230;. well, alarm bells rang! So I explored my security settings and set my search options to only show my name.  Only approved friends can see my photos, and my profile. Thanks for the refresher! It is good practice to regularly check your security settings&#8230;. you just never know if a glitch has changed it all to public or not!</p>

	<p>Just another tip for #7. When you add an application, mouse over your &#8216;settings&#8217; and scroll down to the bottom where you will see &#8216;application settings&#8217; There will usually be 2 tabs, &#8216;bookmark&#8217; and &#8216;additional permissions&#8217;. Select the latter and uncheck the box for &#8216;Publish recent activity (one line stories) to my Wall&#8217;. I do this immediately after adding any application.</p>

	<p>Shyrl- Click on &quot;Chat&quot; at the bottom right corner of the page, and open the box that shows which of your friends are online. Click on &quot;Options&quot; at the top of that box, and select &quot;Go offline&quot;. Once you see the little dot turn grey, you&#039;re offline. If it&#039;s green, then people can see that you&#039;re online. Just remember that if you post something anywhere on Facebook, it will show the time you posted, so people will be able to tell that you&#039;re on Facebook. But if you just want to be invisible and look around, you should be ok.</p>

	<p>Excellent info. But I would like to know how can I block a friend from seeing photos where I was tagged, lets say that today, but without inhibiting him/her to see photos where I was tagged for example, yesterday? In other words, I want to block one user from seeing my recent photos where I am tagged, but I don&#039;t want that user to notice it, so next time he/she visits my profile, he will be able to see the pictures where I was tagged before but not the new ones.</p>

	<p>Hi Nick</p>
<p>Just came across your 10 privacy tips for the 1st time ~ very well explained although I&#039;m pretty sure I was aware of them and have set my own privacy settings to meet my requirements &#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8230; or so I thought!!</p>
<p>I wonder if you can help me with something?</p>
<p>On my Facebook account I have everything (I think) set to high privacy. I use an application that rune under Facebook &#8211; it&#039;s called Farm Town, you might be aware of it.</p>
<p>With Farm Town, as usual, there is a discussion board provided by Facebook. On that discussion board when you post a message a &#039;thumbnail&#039; of your profile photo/graphic is displayed at the side of the post. If privacy settings are not set &#039;high&#039; enough, hovering pointer over photo/graphic causes ID info inc ID # to be displayed in status line.</p>
<p>On my posts I have no photo/graphic and because of my privacy settings no ID info is displayed in status line.</p>
<p>Yet someone claims to have found out &#039;my&#039; IP address from these posts ~ I am a home user and don&#039;t have a static IP address and I guess the IP address this person is seeing/referring to, if any, is that of my ISP. But can you tell me with the info I&#039;ve given you how is it possible for someone to see &#039;my&#039; IP address at all. They can&#039;t click on the photo/graphic next to the post to see my profile, as I say no ID info is displayed when &#039;pointing&#039; to photo/graphic ~ of course this person could be bluffing I&#039;d just like to be sure!! I just can&#039;t figure out how he could do it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance ~ best wishes ~ keep up the great work!!</p>

	<p>New privacy settings are awful! :S They would let anyone see your profile picture, friends, boxes, applications and further information you wouldn&#039;t like to share with 350 million people!! :S Such website should offer you full control of what you want to share, and with whom you want to share it!! People are thinking of removing their Facebook accounts due to this inexplicable change!! Please reconsider what you have done, Facebook!! You&#039;ve always been our favorite! Don&#039;t waste everything now! At least give us the option to restore the old privacy settings&#8230;</p>

	<p>Yes, I agree, they now let people view your friends, and I had a roomate who picked off a lot of people from my friendlist and got their phone numbers and would call them looking for me when he was lonely or bored.<br />
I really don&#8217;t like people seeing all my friends, thats why people have &#8220;circles&#8221; of friends in the real world</p>

	<p>There is a Facebook privacy problem I have not seen addressed on the web. Even if your photos are set to be visible to friends only, if a friend adds a comment to one of your photos, not only that photo but the entire album becomes visible to all their friends, and if that friends wall is open to all, your entire photo album becomes visible to the whole world.</p>

	<p>Hello, I&#039;ve come across something that was not covered. Did the new privacy settings affect a persons FB page if that person has never changed his privacy settings? In other words, the FB page was open to view, but just recently I cannot see his page because of the privacy settings. I am speaking of my sons page, who died in a car accident last year. I was not a member of FB at the time, I joined later. I have since been able to see his wall, see his friends comments, birthdays &amp; such. I cannot post on his wall as I do not know his password &amp; email(he was in college) but it does my heart good to see that he is remembered. Can you help me please?????</p>

<p>But, I can not find that &#039;lock&#039; combo in mine. I explored to Privacy setting and nothing changed. My &#039;SHARE&#039; status is for everyone (except I filtered from privacy setting).</p>

	<p>I can&#039;t believe FB took away the ability to hide friends from things like limited profiles etc. I have an extensive list of contacts which is MY LIST of contacts, now I can&#039;t hide it. It was very short sighted of FB to do this, and quite frankly if I can&#039;t protect my own list of &#039;friends&#039; then I will probably cancel my FB account. The way FB is going and how it approaches privacy is becoming a big problem, a pity someone can&#039;t start a new type of social networking site in competition with FB where we are in full control of our privacy, I&#039;d gladly cancel my FB and switch over.</p>

	<p>I have read (more than)a few of the comments here, not all, but quite a few&#8230;</p>
<p>May i ask ANYONE here INCLUDING the author of this article why do i seem to be the only one wondering if ANYONE has any PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY here???</p>
<p>Facebook is a forum that allows people to accept or deny who and whom they have contacts with.</p>
<p>People decide to put their boss, their mother, and their dog on these friends lists. These SAME people go drink act like asses and do all sorts of stupid shix, they (proudly) post it on facebook &#8211; and OH NO!!!! they got caught!!!</p>
<p>How about people DON&#039;T DO (stupid) THINGS in REAL LIFE and NOT &quot;act&quot; surprised when someone they DON&#039;T want &#8211; notices!!!?!?! I don&#039;t post or do anything that i have no problem with anyone seeing!!! i don&#039;t DO anything that someone can use against me! Perhaps you SHOULDN&#039;T DO IT!!!!! (OMG! NOOOO!) We should worry instead about &quot;privacy&quot; settings implied upon us &#8211; that the same idiots who have something to &quot;hide&quot; will have NO CLUE how to deal with ANYWAY!!!!!</p>
<p>You know what is REALLY wrong with this country??? it&#039;s not Obama, it&#039;s not China, it&#039;s not taxes, it&#039;s &quot;seat belt society.&quot; BEING the FACT: no one is capable or RESPONSIBLE for WHAT THEY DO. Facebook, government, whoever has to save us from what we KNOW what we are doing is WRONG anyway, but we do it, we get caught and while our husbands/wifes are divorcing us and the boss is firing us worry about facebook and it&#039;s privacy settings. &#8211; it&#039;s THEIR FAULT. yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>the internet exposes a-holes and cowardice, if that BOTHERS YOU, you shouldn&#039;t BE HERE!!!!!!</p>
<p>Only the guilty fear the truth and blame the scapegoat. if it is not this site, it will only be another. </p>
<p>WHY DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO DO STUPID THINGS IN LIFE ARE CAPABLE OF FINDING ANY SETTINGS ON A COM &#8211; PUU &#8211; TER? ANYWAY???</p>
<p>now, before i get hate mail (for explaining what SOMEONE had to say) from the odd exception of some abused housewife who&#039;s only contact with her family is here with facebook and she has a violent stalking ex:</p>
<p>YOU MADE IT TO THE COMPUTER!!! EVER HEARD OF EMAIL???? IT WORKS TOO!!!</p>

<p>However, it seems that since the time you wrote this, FB has gone and changed the privacy settings for, well, a whole bunch of stuff, but namely the privacy options for the news feed and live feeds. </p>
<p>You now have no control over what posts gets published or not on the newsfeed and live feed, (unless its an application).</p>

	<p>I already do most of the things in this article but I have one big problem that I can&#039;t seem to correct.  Seems so simple too, and such common sense that it would be inappropriate for FB to post this on my friends &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;News&quot; Feed.  Everytime I drop a friend a line, or like a status, or comment on a picture EVERY SINGLE ONE of my other friends gets a message on their feed that I did that.  Crazy, what was FB thinking?  This has nothing to do with protecting job interests/friendships/relationships and has everything to do with the gossip mill.  I even had a friend access a wall post of another friend of mine and the 2 of them aren&#039;t friends!  And he was able to comment on it!  Is there a way for me to drop a line saying &quot;hello&quot; to a friend of mine without my other 100 friends getting a notification I did that and a link to the note?  GEEZ!  </p>

<p>Until recently I was able to remove my friends list from my profile completely using the little pencil icon .. as they said: by unchecking &quot;the &#039;Show my friends on my profile&#039; option in the Friends box on their profile&quot;</p>
<p>However I logged in today and found that this change has been reversed without any form of prior warning. Presumably this setting was changed some time ago by facebook and has made my private information visible. In essence, private information has been made public without my permission, without forewarning me. </p>
<p>If a user had not logged in for months they may have found that private information has been made public without their consent the entire time. They will not have seen the big banner or privacy settings wizard until now, but the settings were already changed.</p>
<p>They changed my privacy setting without my permission!. </p>
<p>I consider this a violation of my privacy.</p>

	<p>Thanks for your info pertaining to modifying one&#039;s privacy on facebook. I am trying to find out how not to allow others who search my name or even once they become a &quot;friend&quot; to see my friends. This causes so much drama for me. so when people search my profile, what do they see on my page as it stands? I don&#039;t see a setting in the &quot;settings&quot;, then &quot;privacy settings&quot; page for even hiding friends as you stated in the 10th item. I can&#039;t see this. can you tell me how to do this personally? Maybe when you do a search on on my address or name you can tell me what is displayed to the public, but then let&#039;s say after i add you or anyone as a friend, how do hide my friends from that friend or friends or from the public on a search when they come across my profile? I notice some people you can see their friends and some you can&#039;t when you come across their profile.</p>

	<p>When I look at my friends, friends lists and I am listed as a friend, it shows my last update (i.e. my last comments against my profile picture). The friends list shows some other last updates but not others. HOW DO I CHANGE THE SETTINGS SO THAT MINE DO NOT SHOW? (I have all settings to &quot;only friends&quot;) ? Many thanks.</p>

	<p>The new facebook privacy settings are NOT private at all. You no longer have control over your Newsfeed and Wall. Your friends can see all your activity in real time whether you like it or not. Members, including myself, have been complaining and facebook could careless. Facebook now publishes all your activity publicly on the newsfeed and wall without your consent! Privacy???? Puh Lease!!!! Far from it! I&#039;m going back to Myspace!</p>

	<p>I have a question. With the new facebook privacy settings, how can I make it so that nothing that I post on people&#039;s walls shows up on other people&#039;s news feeds? It used to be avaible on the old facebook privacy settings. Addtionally, when I made this happen, i never had to go back to my profile and click &quot;remove&quot; whenever it says &quot;X posted on Y&#039;s wall.&quot; It wasn&#039;t there in the first place.</p>
<p>Look at number 6 on this list. How can I do it again? I don&#039;t want to keep cleaning out my wall of what i&#039;ve done, nor do i want other people to see what i&#039;ve been doing on their news feed.</p>

	<p>Very informative page.  I&#039;d already figured out some of this stuff but its good to have it all listed in one place.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the way to hide friends has changed &#8211; you have to edit your friends box itself (by clicking on the pencil in the top right corner of the box) and uncheck the option that says &quot;Show friend list to everyone&quot;.</p>
<p>This hides it from people that you&#039;re not friends with.  But there is no way to hide your friends list from actual friends, though.</p>

<p>But now everything shows again and I have posts made from a year a go on my wall!</p>

	<p>All these privacy settings is just soo wrong. All Facebook ahve done it change the settings to much more like Twitter. Even if you follow all these detailed steps, your feeds and other information is not totally private. Facebook ahve shot themselves in their own two left feet. I, along with many other users have/will be leaving facebook. Twitter is much better, with better control over privacy.</p>

	<p>1 &#8211; Yes, this info is somewhat outdated but someone took the time to personally break it all down for you before facebook updated things on us yet again. This is not fb&#039;s explanation.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; YES, you can stop people from posting on your wall. However with these new settings from about 2 or 3 weeks ago, you can no longer block the info on your wall that you like or commented or a friend&#039;s photo or status. All you can do is go to your wall &amp; delete each one&#8230;pain I know. Looks like they even took away the option to show/hide changes to your relationship status in the feed &amp; on your wall. Ridiculous!!! So everyone email them they need to give us these option again! <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/suggestions.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/help/suggestions.php</a>  </p>
<p>Here&#039;s how to block anyone from posting to your wall:</p>
<p>Go to settings, privacy settings, profile. Scroll down &amp; uncheck &quot;Friends can post on my Wall.&quot;</p>
<p>3 &#8211; I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not alone in the fact that I want to be able to approve or deny photos I&#039;m tagged in. If my boss was on facebook, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want him seeing some of them&#8230;they&#039;re not bad but just aren&#039;t appropriate from college days 10+ years ago. I suggest everyone inundate facebook with mail about giving us this privacy option as well. If myspace has been able to do this for years now, why can&#039;t facebook?!<br />
  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/suggestions.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/help/suggestions.php</a>  </p>
<p>4 &#8211; If anyone knows how to block your &quot;movements&quot; on fb from being sent to someone&#039;s phone, let me know please. I have an acquaintance that gets alerts when certain people do things &amp; I&#039;m one of them&#8230;I feel like I&#039;m being stalked! I should have the option to opt out of being stalked!!!</p>

	<p>same as Christine.. and I&#039;ve been figuring out how to hide them.. it takes too much space on my profile like whom I posted on the wall and or comment on their photos and stuffs.. and now I see that they says </p>
<p>&quot;You cannot completely turn off recent activity stories anymore. However, if you want to remove a particular story that currently shows up, simply click the &quot;Remove&quot; button that appears to the right of the story after you move your mouse over it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ok.. now you just have to &quot;remove&quot; them everytime you dont want anything like that to appear on your profile.. COOL!.. Not!! *sigh*</p>

	<p>I finally turned off my facebook account. The issue that bothers me the most is the privacy issues on &quot;Friends You Might Know&quot; function. &quot;Friends you might know&quot; sucks!!! Facebook was somehow able to match me up with anyone and everyone I&#039;ve HAD EMAILS FROM/TO&#8212; not just in my email address book. FB sends these to me AND ANYONE IVE EVER EMAILED. So it&#039;s been sending notices to a guy I dated years ago, but have no desire to contact. Unfortunately, I still had some emails from him and Facebook figured we were friends. Lately, the function had been asking me about people I&#039;ve searched on but did not friend, so am assuming they get messages from me to because I searched on them. There is no privacy on Facebook.</p>

	<p>Sh**** if you want to block your movement on facebook you might start by marking yourself offline.  Bottom right of facebook usually shows when you&#039;re friends are on, as well as when you are on (The CHAT box).  Right click and then click Offline&#8230;.this way no one can tell when you&#039;re online and might help.</p>

	<p>Almost none of the settings you advise to adjust in this article are still available on Facebook. FB changed all my settings when they altered the privacy policy too,  intentionally so I would guess, with no options available to change them back. You can&#039;t hide your friends from anyone, public searches or anything else. And I&#039;m still available in searches no matter what settings I change.</p>

I&#039;m frustrated, because I have to keep going in and manually removing them&#8230; besides the fact that it totally takes away from my control, it looks messy.  <img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

	<p>Thanks for the clear rundown. It makes it easy to make sure I&#039;m covered. FYI, I&#039;ve generally held off on using Facebook (I have used it very rarely, and this has been due to privacy concerns). Now I feel I can relax (a bit). I&#039;m very careful what I put on the internet.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t understand why privacy settings are so &#8220;complicated&#8221;, I like the idea of finite control, but they need a &#8220;dummies&#8221; option for &#8220;Friends Only&#8221; for everything at least.</p>
<p>The amount of Friends of Friends, considering how many billions of &#8220;non&#8221; friends people can add is crazy.</p>
<p>Also you should mention the section where your friends can share your information with any application they want, by default!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added this link to my FB status.</p>
<p>I also wish there was a way I could hide my default photo (which I have has a fake image for now) from everyone except friends, and even my Name and Friends list from &#8220;Everyone&#8221;</p>

	<p>This article is great but should be updated: there is still a major privacy issue. The page you are fan and who appear in your information tab on your profile.</p>
<p>Those pages reveal to other your main interest/hobbies and even private information like sexual orientation and there is no privacy option to hide them on your profile. they appear whetever you may do. So it a bit stupid from FB to set up so many privacy settings options but not solving this major privacy issue.</p>
<p>The groups can be hidden in the application tab and set up to &quot;only me&quot; can see.</p>

	<p>So now that they changed the layout I can&#8217;t find the option for NOT posting if I have become someone&#8217;s friend on my wall and feed. I don&#8217;t want people finding out that I just added so-and-so as a friend, but that is the ONLY thing I want to stop from posting on my feed. Unfortunately I have not found a way to do this yet except for blocking everyone from seeing my entire Family and Relationship section in the privacy settings? Can someone help with this?</p>

	<p>The editing of &quot;Photo&#039;s Tagged of You&quot; feature seems to not be working on facebook. Pretty odd, as one would think this would be the most invasive feature. </p>
<p>When I go to my privacy settings this feature does not exist. There is an option under Application- edit settings- then a link saying you can modify privacy controls for photos tagged, but when I click on that link it reverts me back to a page where this feature can not be found.</p>
<p>Is there a way to contact facebook to let them know this feature isn&#039;t working? Or is it hidden somewhere unlikely?</p>

	<p>My privacy settings aren&#039;t being applied as I would expect them to be &#8211; as I found out when I got comments on a status update from people who I didn&#039;t think were able to see it. </p>
<p>I&#039;ve been using friend lists for quite some time, and thought I had it set so that professional contacts can not see status updates and posts on my walls: the setting is &quot;Make visible to &#039;friends&#039;, except &#039;professional&#039; . It turns out that when professional contacts visit my profile they can indeed not see these things. However, my status updates still appear in their news feeds (I switched a friend to my &#039;professional&#039; list and had her check). Also showing up in her news feed is every single post I make to anyone&#039;s wall, regardless of whether she knows them &#8211; I can&#039;t even see that for friends in my own news feed! In my news feed it only shows up when friends post to walls of friends I know.</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea how to fix any of this?</p>

	<p>If people stopped being uptight about stuff like this, and shared all for all to see&#8230;the bar would be lowered and uptight bosses and HR peeps would be publicly exposed for the prudes they are ( prudes = the nerds in school).  And all the weirdos who are uptight worried about someone knowing their business (as if we care) would be the ones having to worry about a job.  The only time this info should be used, is when your trying to hide two girls you are seeing at same time from each other. <img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

	<p>Like Alexandra, and about 10 others above, I hate that you can&#039;t control what appears on the news feed.   Someone wrote:  &quot;You now have no control over what posts gets published or not on the newsfeed and live feed, (unless its an application).&quot;  That&#039;s not so much &quot;user-unfriendly&quot; as &quot;user-abusive&quot;.  I guess they like wreaking havoc on people&#039;s lives &#8212; what&#039;s a ruined friendship, job, or romance if it means more hits for facebook?   I guess you could set up phony accounts&#8211;one for work, one for leisure, etc., if you&#039;re desperate to use the damned thing.   As it is, I suspect facebook is a nightmare waiting to happen to most unsuspecting users, including people who think they&#039;ve got it all figured out.   Organizations opposing these facebook privacy holes can be found using searches, and within facebook itself.</p>

	<p>If you ever joined a group called Stop Facebook Owning its Users&#039; Photos you might want to check it. It&#039;s now called Save Gary McKinnon from Extradition &#8211; 700,00 plus members!. Facebook allowed the group to change its name, aim and purpose and all those people are now members of a group they didn&#039;t join. That&#039;s just wrong.</p>

	<p>My wall posts appearing on all my friends&#039; news feeds really irritates/concerns me. Not only does it clutter up their news feeds but it displays so much more info than previous facebook! You USED to be able to control exactly what was on your newsfeed, but no more sadly. However I have come up with what I THINK (hopefully) may be some sort of solution. </p>
<p>Create a Friends List and include all your casual acquaintances/people who you do not wish to see your posts generally. Obviously this is not ideal, but it helps a bit. For the most part, my closest friends and family were not included in this list, and the majority of my facebook friends WERE. </p>
<p>Then go into your privacy settings -&gt; profile information -&gt; posts by me. click custom and under &quot;hide this from&quot; enter the name of the friends list. </p>
<p>you can do the same for posts by friends and comments on posts. </p>
<p>as i say, not ideal, but better than nothing i suspect!</p>

	<p>Quick question: when I restrict someone from seeing MY updates, they then cannot see my wall at all. Facebook has two different settings (&#8220;can see my posts&#8221; and &#8220;can post on my wall&#8221;), but both are disabled when I check only the former. I don’t mind if they see friends posts, and I’d like them to be able to post themselves, I just don&#8217;t want them to see my status updates.  But when I block that, the whole wall disappears and they can&#8217;t write on it.  Help? Thank you!!</p>

<p>got a Q. before i was able to group friends in different lists and hide these subsets of friends lists and their posts from the other subsets of friends. now it seems that all my friends regardless of their listing in the subsets can access all info, content of the other subsets of friends lists and their postings via my profile. this means i can&#039;t keep info private to different types of my different friends lists. i understand one can turn of the &#039;show my friends list&#039; to outsiders but all friends are able to access the friends list. is there a way to restore the previous way where keeping different friends groups seperate? thx for info.</p>

<p>As for comments on photos or posts, and indeed ones own wallposts &#8211; it is ALL now visible on ALL of our friends&#039; news feeds thanks to the new facebook privacy settings. </p>
<p>If you don&#039;t like it (as I don&#039;t &#8211; it allows for much LESS control over who sees what than before) then write to facebook!</p>

<p>Block! You are engaging in behavior that may be considered annoying or abusive by other users.</p>
<p>The system Facebook has found that almost all your friendship requests are rejected. Facebook is a safe environment where people know each other in a secure way to communicate with friends and acquaintances. There are limits to friendship requests refused, because this behavior is perceived as annoying by other users Facebook.Je should stop sending friend requests to people you do not know. If you continue to abuse this feature, we can permanently block your account. For more information, please read FAQ</p>

	<p>@Rachid OUDRA: Since Facebook made changes a few weeks ago some of these tips are outdated. To hide your friends list from non-friends now you have to go to your profile and click on the pencil icon in the upper right-hand corner of your friends box. Then uncheck the box that says &quot;Show Friends List to Everyone.&quot;</p>

	<p>Thank you so much for posting this.  I&#039;m trying to &quot;get out&quot; more, but have heard horror stories about Facebook.  I decided to give it a try, found a RL friend, and started my foray out into the &quot;real&quot; world.  Less than five minutes later, I see she&#039;s tagged me in photos!  ACK!  I asked her not to because I didn&#039;t know I could control this myself.  </p>
<p>Awesome bit of work, and much appreciated by those of us with trust issues.  <img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

	<p>I figured out how to do #10 since the changes. When you&#8217;re logged in, click on your profile (NOT the account settings or privacy settings, just basic profile view). You should see your wall and on the left, the box with your friends. There should be a little pencil picture showing that you can edit it. Click on it and uncheck the &#8220;Show Friends to Everyone&#8221; box. Voila!</p>

	<p>There is no way to make your friend list private.</p>
<p>You can only change it from &quot;Everyone&quot; or &quot;Friends&quot; Apparently, like some idiots here, FB believes that all levels of friendship are equal. My neighbor is my friend and my sister is my friend, but I do not want my neighbor contacting my sister; get it!</p>

	<p>These security options are a bit outdated.  I can not make the adjustments because the instructions do not make sense &#8211; i.e there is not a settings icon on my profile or wall page.  Clicking on account settings does not have the same menu items listed above.  Specifically #9 which I am trying to do&#8230;.it reads :</p>
<p>&quot;Within your profile page you can control who can view wall postings made by your friends. To do so, click on the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; icon on the wall in your profile page.</p>
<p>This does not exist on my profile page!!!!</p>
<p>&quot;Next, find the box pictured in the image above and adjust the setting which says &ldquo;Who can see posts made by friends?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d suggest using a strategy similar to the one outlined in the previous step regarding contact information.&quot;</p>
<p>Again &#8211; this does not exist on my pages.  It must be old info!</p>

	<p>i got a suggestion (becuase I DID IT MY SELF)</p>
<p>step 1: when you make an EMAIL address..DONT USE YOUR REAL NAME</p>
<p>STEP 2: make one email address for &quot;JUNK MAIL&quot;</p>
<p>make one email add for &#039;chat rooms&#039;</p>
<p>make one email address for friends/coworkers</p>
<p>make one email address for &#039;personaly like JOBS&#039;</p>
<p>make one email address for FAMILY</p>
<p>now the one for the &quot;JUNK EMAIL&quot; you use for the facebook account&#8211;select a few people you know personaly&#8211;dont put your real photo</p>
<p>NOW NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO &#039;FIND YOU..now that is PRIVACY&#039;</p>
<p>my internet issue now is things i posted on line years ago..CANT BE TAKEN DOWN&#8211;EVEN THOUGH I ASK THE WEB SITE TO &#039;ALTER&#039; MY NAME&#8230;they just told me ONECE ITS POSTED ITS HERE FOR EVER</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>NOW for some one who realy want to be BAD (this will be mean&#8211;evil)</p>
<p>if there is one person you dont like for any reason and you some how get there REAL PHOTO&#8230;save that person picture on your computer..and post REAL INFORMATION about them.. this can do REAL DAMAGE&#8230;like i said onece its posted its there forever!! so PLEASE BECAREFUL WHAT YOU TELL PEOPLE&#8211;AND BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO AND SAY (EVEN IF its ment as a JOKE) it can have some real DAMAGE&#8212;and as far as &#039;how&#039; long it will take to post an entire, &quot;encyclopedia&quot; of some one it can be done in less than 10 seconds&#8230;SINCE THE FILE IS SAVED AS A NOTEPAD FILE..OPEN THE NOTEPAD file, open the web site&#8230;copy  notepad profile, past profile from notepad to internet&#8230;.AND BANG&#8230;.YOU GOT THE PERSON LIFE HISTORY ON LINE&#8230;. (and then you decided to EMAIL THEM FROM A &#039;FAKE EMAIL ACCOUNT&#8230;&gt; informing them they have a new internet profile&#8212;and you show them the profile..some how&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;HOW DIRTY CAN YOU BE</p>

	<p>Bronson,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid it was possible prior to Facebook&#8217;s most recent changes, but no longer.  I had changed it in fact, and it was reverted.  Facebook is really getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic&#8230;Facebook is trying to make a good move by becoming &#8216;more open&#8217; but in fact they are confusing the hell out of us as we chase their settings all over their site, causing us to loose trust in the platform and generally pissing people off by taking what we&#8217;ve come to know as a &#8216;personal&#8217; space and making it increasingly public.</p>
<p>I prefer Twitter these days.</p>

	<p>Like this. I would like to know how to avoid a picture being tagged.</p>
<p>I am starting a photography page, and have lots of photos on my own personal site, and I don&#039;t want people to be able to tag even if they are a friend, especially if they are a client. </p>
<p>I know some people can tag even without my consent. I do get some requests, but I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s not on all my photos.</p>
<p>Any advice.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>

	<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The problem with privacy settings is that it&#039;s true that creating friend lists is good but by doing this, excluded lists (or not included list) cannot see any more or publish any comment nor on my wall neither on pictures.</p>
<p>What would be great would be to create another kind of group that could also publish comments on my wall or on any picture but that could be seen only by people part of this group and not just exclude them definitively as it is now.</p>
<p>Sometimes I want a picture to be seen by everyone and I want also that everyone can publish something BUT I don&#039;t want that anyone see the comment of another one.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>

	<p>Hi, nice guide bit it didnt really answer the question that is burning a hole in my brain. Can you block a friend from seeing a friend? My brothers friend is a perv, we have come to accept his ways but every time my bro gets talking to a girl on facebook, this guy comes along and starts flirting with the girls, trying to steal them so to speak. My brother has asked him to stop but he cant control himself. It would be easier if he could be blocked from seeing certain people.</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice x x</p>

	<p>This is a great site and a good idea but it needs updating.  Facebook has changed its privacy content and a lot of what has been stated above, by the author, no longer applies.</p>
<p>For instance, I&#039;ve contacted Facebook requesting they reinstate the ability to hide your friend list from everyone.  Currently who ever is connected on FB can view each other&#039;s friend list.  Also the feature enabling you to hide tagged photos no longer works.</p>
<p>If anyone knows how they can get these features brought back, I&#039;m more than happy to join in.</p>

	<p>I saw on the Recent News feed that someone I knew wrote on a mutual friend&#039;s wall, but when I went to the writer&#039;s profile under their recent activity, it didn&#039;t say that they had written on that person&#039;s wall. Is there a way to block people from knowing when someone just WRITES on another person&#039;s wall on facebook, not just &quot;commenting&quot; or &quot;liking&quot; something?</p>

	<p>Someone above posted this workaround:</p>
<p>I figured out how to do #10 since the changes. When you&rsquo;re logged in, click on your profile (NOT the account settings or privacy settings, just basic profile view). You should see your wall and on the left, the box with your friends. There should be a little pencil picture showing that you can edit it. Click on it and uncheck the &ldquo;Show Friends to Everyone&rdquo; box. Voila!</p>

	<p>TO MAKE YOUR FRIENDS LIST PRIVATE:</p>
<p>1. Go to your profile page.</p>
<p>2. Look on the left side where you see pictures of your friends. Click the little pencil above their pictures.</p>
<p>3. Uncheck the box &quot;Show Friend List to Everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>Note: Your friends and networks can still see your friend list. There is no option to completely hide your list from everyone.</p>

	<p>Useful tips, but I haven&#039;t found an information I need. What to do when somebody creates a fake profile of you and operates with it. I am having this problem at school where I teach. I didn&#039;t want to add the students to my friends&#039; list. Somebody has created a FAKE profile of ME and now there are around 60 &quot;friends&quot; (students). I have reported it several times, but it seems like nobody cares about these reports. I am starting to really hate Facebook from this experience.</p>

	<p>My profile privace page does not even have an option that would let me filter who can see my friends list and who can&#039;t and I think this is a serious drawback of facebook. Although it is a socializing arena, some things should be under our control, like who can see our friends list or not. Eventually, I figured out that if you have a common friend, you can even add that person as a friend and I think that is just plain ridiculous. I have been getting tons of random invites, and it is not cool. Does anyone know if there&#039;s a solution to this?</p>

	<p>It doesn&rsquo;t explain though how I can make some tagged photos (individual photos) can only be seen by certain friends while the rest can be seen by all friends. Privacy setting only apply to ALL (general) tagged photos. So if I want a tagged photo be able to be seen by 5 friends only (but not as a general rule), what should I do?</p>
<p>Anybody can help?</p>

<p>You DO realize FB removed our control to display or not our friendships, right?</p>
<p>Facebook quietly restored the settings to hide your friends&#8230;</p>
<p>Go to:</p>
<p>- Account</p>
<p>- Privacy Settings</p>
<p>- Friends, tabs and connections</p>
<p>For &#039;Friends&#039; you have three choices: Everyone, Friends of Friends, Friends or Custom</p>
<p>To hide all your friends select &quot;custom&quot; and then in &quot;Make this visible to&quot; &quot;These People&quot; select &quot;Only me&quot;</p>

	<p>Currently, Facebook restore the settings to hide our friends. But they have &quot;Mutual Friend&quot; or &quot;Friend in common&quot; that we can&#039;t hide.</p>
<p>So our friend may know some our friendlist that already exist in their friendlist.</p>
<p>Basically, Facebook still does not give us complete control to what we can share and what we do not want to share.</p>

	<p>Can someone please help me? Just yesterday, I noticed that my posts/photo uploads DO NOT appear at the common FB page where my friends can see them automatically. The same posts can ONLY be seen in my own wall (profile. Is this just some kind of a computer glitch of FB? I just checked my settings and all seems how I want them to be. Needless to say, I noticed my posts not appearing any longer in the public wall even without modifying my settings. I heard some accounts have been &quot;cancelled&quot; by FB for reasons known only perhaps to them. Hope you can help. Thank you.</p>

	<p>couldn&#039;t read through all the comments. too many. the biggest nuisance is how if i am a member of a group and post a comment, the comment gets broadcast to everyone on my friends list, even if they are not in the group. this means that if i take part in a group discussion, EVERY comment i make in the discussion, THE WHOLE THING, gets broadcast to everyone on my friends list. this is annoying to me and them. if someone is in a gardening group and compliments someone&#039;s melons, EVERYONE on their whole friends list needs to read that whole conversation? facebook must have some sort of deathwish as a business. they take almost every opportunity to piss off its members.</p>

	<p>Hi, though the look of the settings panes in this article is from and older version of FB. It really helped me address issues. I&#039;m very sure privacy is not a term that can apply to what you share, so I use it to refer to whom I wish to share it with. </p>
<p>I log about FB-related things and Internet Marketing and linked your article as reference for my readers to come and get an idea of what they can do. </p>

	<p>seriously&#8230; the only person that can protect your privacy is YOU. handing over your most intimate details to some faceless international empire is just plain stupid. Hide your phone number, fer shame&#8230; why did you put it on there in the first place?</p>
<p>I suspect facebook&#039;s secret advantage here is that by working on a typically legal name basis, they trick stupid white bread into thinking they are filling out &quot;legal documents&quot; and as such provide as much information as they are asked for.</p>
<p>Even your best &quot;long lost&quot; friends will be happy with a few neutral happy snaps and knowing when your birthday is. And FB does this just fine. Otherwise try hitting &quot;my account&gt; privacy&quot; once in a whole. Facebook is a business, not a governemnt entity, not a welfare group and certainly not a genuine community.</p>
<p>When I google my name, or email, or even search my name without being logged in or from a non-friended acc. on FB, I get &quot;no picture&quot; and my name. That&#039;s it.</p>
<p>How hard can it be to just hit &quot;friends only&quot; or &quot;just me&quot; and check it once in a while, while remembering not to put anything you would not want anyone to see on the FUCKING INTERNET? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, boogers&#8230; sorry, I mean BLOGGERS&#8230;continue to make money from simultaneously &quot;exposing the horribly truth&quot; and making a whole lot of noise about nothing whatsoever that you cannot fix yourself.</p>
<p>So someone can see a photo of you? Knows your gender? What&#039;s the problem? And if you have no idea what the problem ISN&#039;T, then you should probably take an internet 101.</p>
<p>first rule of net club&#8230; you don&#039;t upload anything unless you want potentiall millions of people seeing it</p>
<p>second rule of net club &#8211; if they do, most of em won&#039;t care. they will seriously give less of a shit than God does about an ant dying. Why do you think you matter so much to anyone else?</p>
<p>third rule of net club &#8211; see rule one.</p>

	<p>The friends list has been very helpful, but I know there must be a way to show only certain friends and hide others. For instance, I found an old friend on FB and it said she had four friends, but yet when another friend of mine, who was a facebook friend of this same person, when she clicked on their page, it said they had thirty-seven friends. How did she hide certain friends from me and the public, but showed other friends to her FB friends?</p>

	<p>Cheers for this Nick it will come in very useful. The one point that you didn&#039;t cover is the one that I find most irritating and wonder if you or anyone else has a solution to it.The major problem I find is the chat section of facebook, the minute you log on some instantly barrages you with hello , hi, ect. on other sites such as msn, you can log in invisably can this be done on facebook or is there another way to do this.</p>

	<p>Thanks, this is important. Although privacy is everyone&#8217;s personal responsibility, when we join things like facebook we abdicate some of this responsibility &#8211; and some of the risk &#8211; to the provider.  We exchange it for some functionality and the trust that the provider will look after our interests. The problem with facebook is that it isn&#8217;t holding up its end of the bargain. By not better helping people to understand the consequence of their daily decisions, they are putting their users at risk. It&#8217;s a disgrace that they don&#8217;t take more responsibility now that facebook is becoming near ubiquitous.  In the meantime, we need guides like yours and I&#8217;d encourage everyonee to buy the full version.</p>

	<p>what is &quot;Things others share Photos and videos I&#039;m tagged in&quot;</p>
<p>I am so very confused with this&#8230;because i had customized  all my photos/videos i share are only seen by &#039;friends only&#039; in which this case i would want to. </p>
<p>But, how about my friends if they tag me in their share of photos, will my other friends (not common friend) see the photos i&#039;m into? when i indicate &#039;friends of friends&#039; at &quot;Things others share Photos and videos I&#039;m tagged in&quot; even though my friends photo sharing is &#039;only friends&#039;</p>

	<p>Last night, just for fun, I did a search of my name. I used Bing, not google. I found a site with extremely racist terms, who had taken comments from facebook, and printed the discussion. apparently, they had looked for non-racists to publish about. The name of the site is &quot;Trolling N*****s and N***** LOvers on facebook.&quot; and they list a site called chimpout.com. which is also extremely racist. They printed a comment I made in a discussion about race, responding to a racist person. How and why did they get this discussion and how can I prevent being shown on a site such as this again? Or any site without my permission?</p>

	<p>Thanks for this advice, but most useful tip: Don&#039;t use facebook period. Or get rid of Newsfeed completely. Then all your problems will be solved. All the privacy options are way too complicated to make the usage of this site enjoyable anymore. Having to navigate through all of the intricate privacy settings for every single publishing is an unnecessary hassle. Besides, life is not meant to be lived over a computer screen. I have been facebook free for 2+ years and continue to have a healthy, secure, and satisfying social life. Everyone should do the same.</p>

	<p>I would like everyone to know that I happened to give a gift to my kids on their Facebook accounts of pearls for the Happy Aquarium.  I did not know that my credit card would be saved onto their accounts until one of my children decided to buy Facebook credits and found that my credit card was right there to purchase them without any question!  I found out a week later (and $250.00 later).  I have been emailing Facebook (the only way to get in touch with them) the past two weeks and they refuse to refund my money &#8211; as they state that it is not fraud and my last email from them stated that if I stop the payments at the bank my Facebook account will be limited for use!  When I used my credit card I thought it should only be saved to my Facebook account as the credit card was under my name but that is not the case.  This has become quite the nightmare.</p>
<p>I would like everyone to know that if they use their credit card to purchase anything for anyone else their credit card will be saved on the Facebook account weather the names match or not!</p>

	<p>I have a question. Does facebook respect the intersection of friend lists? For example if I have friend list &ldquo;New York&rdquo; and a friendlist &ldquo;Tennis&rdquo;, those are two different characterizations of friends, one based on location and one based on hobby. There may be tennis players out of new york and new yorkers who don&rsquo;t play tennis.</p>
<p>Now if I&rsquo;m going to make a post on my wall and say that the post should be visible only to the lists &ldquo;New York&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tennis&rdquo; then what I really want, is that that posting is visible to tennis players living in new york, i.e. the intersection of those two friend lists.</p>
<p>Is that so? Or, which would be bad, is the post visible to the union of those two friend lists?</p>
<p>Of course this principle should be applied to more than two friend lists, but I guess this is hardly ever neccessary.</p>

	<p>When Facebook first came out my work mate opened an account for me and since I did not use it I closed it.</p>
<p>Two months ago I decided I would like to have a account, and opened an account with my same email address. </p>
<p>I had several Art &amp; Fashion related people from different parts of the world on it and of course a few close friends.</p>
<p>Recently someone I knew tried to find me with my email address and it opened my old account and now I can not get into my new account. This is very disturbing! Since I have no idea how to remedy this problem. I tried closing this account and getting back into my new account and all it does is to open my old account again. There are many people with my same name but only me with the same email address and I even wrote a letter to Facebook explaining my problem and as of yet haven&#039;t received a reply.  There is no way that I can even check messages on my new account because I can view the page but since The two have the same email address I can not get into it. I do not know why facebook let me open another account with the same email address but they did.</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone gets in touch with me and we can remnedy this problem.  Any Ideas?   Thank You</p>

<p>I cannot understand the author using &#039;their relationship&#039; instead of &#039;her&#039; (there is no mention of the man or couple prior to that). Perhaps FB is influencing English usage? I hope not!</p>

	<p>Can you tell us how to remove all of our indexed information from Google search?  I don&#039;t mean anything you listed above.  I mean if someone searches my name they will see a list of everything I&#039;ve posted to a public page.  I&#039;m fine with someone who is a friend seeing what I post. And I&#039;m fine with people who post to a particular fan page seeing what I post.  I&#039;m not fine with anyone on the Internet being able to pull up a list of everything I&#039;ve posted.  It&#039;s not the same at all.  Particularly when you think of something like a potential employer.  I don&#039;t mean anything embarrassing, but the full effect of seeing everything listed that way is different than seeing them in real time or in the context of a particular page.  Try searching someone who has a maiden name for their full name and you will probably find only their information in the results.  (e.g. There might be many Jane Does and many Jane Smiths, but not many or only one Jane Doe Smith.)  Try that with the name of someone you know and suddenly you see everything they&#039;ve done in a list.  And we want to keep our maiden names so our old friends will know it&#039;s us!</p>

	<p>There seems to be a trend of misuse evolving in the e-world and I cannot speak for other males but it seems to be more so with females searching for men. I know this may sound sexist, but you rarely see male prostitution rampant on the streets like we seem to see a similar condition with women transcending in the e-world now. Our youth seem to playing it up more so than mature adults of both genders.</p>
<p>I believe it should be required that anyone new that you do not know who requests a friend add should have at least an attached message to introduce themselves and in that brief message as to how and why they found you. We live too often by mere assumption today.</p>
<p>I believe this should be a tradition of etiquette and respect as in the old custom of making a phone call- You identify yourself as the caller. Not just merely holding an anonamous photo up without any written language as if to say, here I am, open for business. Come and get me. It is creating an e-world intimidation that I think will be short lived as soon as anyone with a IQ of 60 discovers this street trend.</p>
<p>I have many [female friends] that I have never heard from- How do we know they are not just moderators in cognito for the e-authority? </p>
<p>I think in over five years of Myspace and Facebook now, I have probably sent maybe 2 or 3, maybe only 4 at the most requests for a friend add to a female. I always attached a message that I found them interesting for their art or science background. Not for a photo op image. Our world has become what I have termed as &ldquo;Image is Anything Today [But Not Necessarily Everything]&rdquo; as once quoted.</p>
<p>The word, &ldquo;artless&rdquo; comes to mind now.</p>
<p>Why do I receive hundreds of requests from females with no attached message even when I ask for one before accepting them? There is never a response even after adding them?</p>
<p>Many I have come to find are only trying to sell female services- This was a common problem in Myspace that eventually destroyed it. What does this say about our e-world and privacy or our lack of taste for the finer things in life?</p>
<p>Does this ever cause anyone any lack of confidence?</p>

	<p>I have a question that I can&#039;t seem to find an answer to.  I don&#039;t mind most of my friends of a friends seeing some of my stuff.  There is one guy who is a friend of many of my friends that I went to high school with.  I have no interest in being his friend.  He keeps trying to add me and I just ignore him.  I don&#039;t necessarily want to block him.  I tried to customize my settings so he can&#039;t see certain things.  Can I only do that if they are already a friend?  I went back into my settings today and his name wasn&#039;t there anymore.</p>

(For example:  Jane Doe &gt; John Doe: HeyJohn! How&#039;s it going? Aww&#8230;I see you have a baby now. Lucky you! He&#039;s adorable&#8230;Congrats! )   </p>

	<p>Thanks SO MUCH mate!  </p>
<p>I&#039;m a Gen Y lad with a good education so I am pretty wary about privacy online. Although I knew of some of these settings I certainly didn&#039;t know all of them and am now about to further refine my Fb privacy settings.  </p>
<p>I really think people ought to restrict their personal photos and personal information etc. to those they trust well &#8211; you can do this and still retain so many other people as &quot;friends&quot; on Fb (without enabling them to intrude too far into your personal life).  </p>
<p>Too many people I know have such a vague idea about how exposed they are online (too all and sundry). We really should try to encouorage they take the time to learn about privacy issues and how to protect themselves from unwanted attention etc!</p>

	<p>Can anybody tell me?????<br />
If you &#039;Like&#039; a page on FB, does that automatically give the &#039;owner&#039; of the page the same access as a &#039;Friend&#039;.  For example, I have locked my daughter&#039;s account down so tight, and because I didn&#039;t know the answer to this, had to remove about 500 pages where she had clicked on &#039;Like&#039;. </p>
<p>My worry is that anybody can create a funny page, and kids start clicking on it.  However, behind the fun exterior could be somebody with less than honorable intentions wanting access to FB pages of young adults. </p>

	<p>It is quite possible that I may be the last computer literate individual who has not even logged onto a facebook page.  I feel that there is way too much information out there and while I personally have nothing to hide, the voyeuristic value of facebook does not intrigue me.  Adding to that is the unending privacy/security issues makes the entire concept quote discerning.  However change is inevitable and in order to keep up with trends one must be open, albeit cautiously, to this ever evolving technological society.  This article provided me with invaluable information and allowed me to be brave enough &quot;boldly go&quot; where I have never gone before.  Much gratitude for the fortitude you have provided.</p>

	<p>Do you know a way to prevent your friends from seeing comments in your photos from other friends?, my privacy is extremely important for me, I don&#039;t want my friends to know my other friends and I have everything pretty well setup, one thing I haven&#039;t been able to do is preventing FriendX to see that FriendY liked my photo and commented on it, so now FriendX knows I have FriendY in my friends list <img src='http://www.allfacebook.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>

IMO making facebook a &quot;mandatory&quot; step of submitting posts should be illegal. I guess I am in the minority though.</p>

	<p>How do I make the photos tab available to the &quot;Limited profile&quot; i have on my friends list? I want them to view only certain albums and though I have changed &quot;Edit Album Privacy&quot; to include Limited profile for those particular albums, the photos tab is still not available to the limited profile people. Also, I am unable to find the &quot;Photos application&quot; under &quot;Application settings&quot; so that I can select profile tab in &quot;Edit photo settings&quot; pop up box to change it to something other than &quot;Only me&quot; as is said in the Help Center.</p>

	<p>Here are some of my tips: If stalkers make a request to add you as friends, make sure to permanently delete the request. Many people make the mistake of click on the &quot;not now&quot; but forget to go to the &quot;delete request&quot;. This can cause some info or activity you do to be visible to those stalkers who added a request, such as events that you attend, etc. </p>
<p>The other is about what you post on your friends wall. If the stalkers somehow find out who your friends are through your public profile, then that can cause issues. If you have friends who accept anyone as friends without knowing them personally, then there is a chance that stalkers who want to stalk you might make friends with your friends. And if the stalker has your close friend added to their friends and they accept, then all your posts on your friends wall can possibly be visible to the stalker. So just make sure not to post any personal info like where you want to meet your friend today or tomorrow on their wall. Cuz a stalker just might be watching. Rather text them on their phone. Hope that helps.</p>

	<p>Did you know that even if someone has their FB real secure you can still see their photos. All you have to do is know who their friends are. If you know any of their friends you will go into their friends FB and on there wall you search what their friends are saying and if they comment on one of their photos all you have to do is click on the photo or the word PHOTO and Boom!! there you have it.. all of their photos open up even if they have you blocked. If you look at their photo and then go to the persons profile page and try to look at them it won&#039;t let you see anything, but if you just keep clicking the next button you&#039;ll see all the photos that way&#8230; Just thought everyone should know that it&#039;s not as secure as you might think, even if your setting are secure&#8230; Be aware&#8230;</p>
