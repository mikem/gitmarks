<h3>Information Software and the Graphical Interface</h3>

<h4>by Bret Victor</h4>

<div id="frontmatter">

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p id="p54" onmouseover="pIn(54)" onmouseout="pOut(54)"><a id="a54" class="anchor" href="#p54"># </a>The ubiquity of frustrating, unhelpful software interfaces has motivated decades of research into &#8220;Human-Computer Interaction.&#8221;  In this paper, I suggest that the long-standing focus on &#8220;interaction&#8221; may be misguided.  For a majority subset of software, called &#8220;information software,&#8221; I argue that interactivity is actually a curse for users and a crutch for designers, and users&#8217; goals can be better satisfied through other means.</p>

<p id="p55" onmouseover="pIn(55)" onmouseout="pOut(55)"><a id="a55" class="anchor" href="#p55"># </a>Information software design can be seen as the design of <em>context-sensitive information graphics</em>.  I demonstrate the crucial role of information graphic design, and present three approaches to context-sensitivity, of which interactivity is the last resort.  After discussing the cultural changes necessary for these design ideas to take root, I address their implementation.  I outline a tool which may allow designers to create data-dependent graphics with no engineering assistance, and also outline a platform which may allow an unprecedented level of implicit context-sharing between independent programs.  I conclude by asserting that the principles of information software design will become critical as technology improves.</p>

<p id="p56" onmouseover="pIn(56)" onmouseout="pOut(56)"><a id="a56" class="anchor" href="#p56"># </a>Although this paper presents a number of concrete design and engineering ideas, the larger intent is to introduce a &#8220;unified theory&#8221; of information software design, and provide inspiration and direction for progressive designers who suspect that the world of software isn&#8217;t as flat as they&#8217;ve been told.</p>

<h2 id="scope_and_terminology">Scope and terminology</h2>

<p id="p57" onmouseover="pIn(57)" onmouseout="pOut(57)"><a id="a57" class="anchor" href="#p57"># </a>&#8220;<b>Software</b>,&#8221; as used here, refers to user-facing personal desktop software, whether on a native or web platform.  &#8220;<b>Software design</b>&#8221; describes all appearance and behaviors visible to a user; it approaches software as a <em>product</em>.  &#8220;<b>Software engineering</b>&#8221; implements the design on a computer; it approaches software as a <em>technology</em>.  These are contentious definitions; hopefully, this paper itself will prove far more contentious.</p>

It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can <b>answer questions</b>. It can <b>affect the world</b> by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer&#8217;s spells.<br />

<p id="p59" onmouseover="pIn(59)" onmouseout="pOut(59)"><a id="a59" class="anchor" href="#p59"># </a>Merlin had it easy&#8212;raising Stonehenge was a mere engineering challenge.  He slung some weighty stones, to be sure, but their placement had only to please a subterranean audience whose interest in the matter was rapidly decomposing.  The dead are notoriously unpicky.</p>

<p id="p60" onmouseover="pIn(60)" onmouseout="pOut(60)"><a id="a60" class="anchor" href="#p60"># </a>Today&#8217;s software magicians carry a burden heavier than 13-foot monoliths&#8212;communication with the living.  They often approach this challenge like Geppetto&#8217;s fairy&#8212;attempting to instill the spark of life into a mechanical contraption, to create a Real Boy.  Instead, their vivified creations often resemble those of Frankenstein&#8212;helpless, unhelpful, maddeningly stupid, and prone to accidental destruction.</p>

<p id="p61" onmouseover="pIn(61)" onmouseout="pOut(61)"><a id="a61" class="anchor" href="#p61"># </a>This is a software crisis, and it isn&#8217;t news.  For decades, the usability pundits have devoted vim and vitriol to a crusade against frustrating interfaces.  Reasoning that the cure for unfriendly software is to make software friendlier, they have rallied under the banner of &#8220;interaction design,&#8221; spreading the gospel of friendly, usable interactivity to all who would listen.</p>

<p id="p62" onmouseover="pIn(62)" onmouseout="pOut(62)"><a id="a62" class="anchor" href="#p62"># </a>Yet, software has remained frustrating, and as the importance of software to society has grown, so too has the crisis.  The crusade marches on, with believers rarely questioning the sacred premise&#8212;that software must be interactive in the first place.  That software is meant to be &#8220;used.&#8221;</p>

<p id="p63" onmouseover="pIn(63)" onmouseout="pOut(63)"><a id="a63" class="anchor" href="#p63"># </a>I suggest that the root of the software crisis is an identity crisis&#8212;an unclear understanding of what the medium actually <em>is</em>, and what it&#8217;s <em>for</em>.  Perhaps the spark of life is misdirected magic.
<span class="sidenote">A good introduction to the crisis is Alan Cooper&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672326140">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> (1999).  Essential concepts of interactive design are presented in Don Norman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465067107">Design Of Everyday Things</a> (2002), Jef Raskin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201379376">The Humane Interface</a> (2000), and Cooper&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764526413">About Face</a> (2003).</span></p>

<h2 id="what_is_software_design">What is software design?</h2>

<p id="p64" onmouseover="pIn(64)" onmouseout="pOut(64)"><a id="a64" class="anchor" href="#p64"># </a>A person experiences modern software almost exclusively through two channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>She reads and interprets pictures on a screen.</li>
<li>She points and pushes at things represented on the screen, using a mouse as a proxy finger.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p65" onmouseover="pIn(65)" onmouseout="pOut(65)"><a id="a65" class="anchor" href="#p65"># </a>Thus, software design involves the design of two types of artifact:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pictures.</li>
<li>Things to push.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p66" onmouseover="pIn(66)" onmouseout="pOut(66)"><a id="a66" class="anchor" href="#p66"># </a>These are not brave new realms of human endeavor.  We share the blood of cavemen who pushed spears into mammoths and drew pictures of them in the living room.  By now, these two activities have evolved into well-established design disciplines:  graphic design and industrial design.</p>

<p id="p67" onmouseover="pIn(67)" onmouseout="pOut(67)"><a id="a67" class="anchor" href="#p67"># </a><strong>Graphic design</strong> is the art of conveying a message on a two-dimensional surface.  This is a broad field, because people have such a variety of messages to convey&#8212;identity, social status, emotion, persuasion, and so on.  Most relevant to software is a branch that Edward Tufte calls <em>information design</em>&#8212;the use of pictures to express knowledge of interest to the reader.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Edward Tufte, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392142">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> (2001).</span>      Some products of conventional information graphic design include bus schedules, telephone books, newspapers, maps, and shopping catalogs.  A good graphic designer understands how to arrange information on the page so the reader can ask and answer questions, make comparisons, and draw conclusions.</p>

<p id="p68" onmouseover="pIn(68)" onmouseout="pOut(68)"><a id="a68" class="anchor" href="#p68"># </a>When the software designer defines the visual representation of her program, when she describes the pictures that the user will interpret, she is doing graphic design, whether she realizes this or not.</p>

<p id="p69" onmouseover="pIn(69)" onmouseout="pOut(69)"><a id="a69" class="anchor" href="#p69"># </a><strong>Industrial design</strong> is the art of arranging and shaping a physical product so it can be manipulated by a person.  This too is a broad field, because people work with such a variety of objects&#8212;cutlery to chairs, cell phones to cars.  A good industrial designer understands the capabilities and limitations of the human body in manipulating physical objects, and of the human mind in comprehending mechanical models.  A camera designer, for example, shapes her product to fit the human hand.  She places buttons such that they can be manipulated with index fingers while the camera rests on the thumbs, and weights the buttons so they can be easily pressed in this position, but won&#8217;t trigger on accident.  Just as importantly, she designs an understandable <em>mapping</em> from physical features to functions&#8212;pressing a button snaps a picture, pulling a lever advances the film, opening a door reveals the film, opening another door reveals the battery.</p>

<p id="p70" onmouseover="pIn(70)" onmouseout="pOut(70)"><a id="a70" class="anchor" href="#p70"># </a>Although software is the archetypical non-physical product, modern software interfaces have evolved overtly mechanical metaphors.  Buttons are pushed, sliders are slid, windows are dragged, icons are dropped, panels extend and retract.  People are encouraged to consider software a machine&#8212;when a button is pressed, invisible gears grind and whir, and some internal or external state is changed.  Manipulation of machines is the domain of industrial design.</p>

<p id="p71" onmouseover="pIn(71)" onmouseout="pOut(71)"><a id="a71" class="anchor" href="#p71"># </a>When the software designer defines the interactive aspects of her program, when she places these pseudo-mechanical affordances and describes their behavior, she is doing a virtual form of industrial design.  Whether she realizes it or not.</p>

<p id="p72" onmouseover="pIn(72)" onmouseout="pOut(72)"><a id="a72" class="anchor" href="#p72"># </a>The software designer can thus approach her art as a fusion of graphic design and industrial design.  Now, let&#8217;s consider how a user approaches software, and more importantly, <em>why</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what_is_software_for">What is software for?</h2>

<p id="p73" onmouseover="pIn(73)" onmouseout="pOut(73)"><a id="a73" class="anchor" href="#p73"># </a>Software is for people.  To derive what software should do, we have to start with what <em>people</em> do.  Consider the following taxonomy of human activity:<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* There are any number of ways of breaking down the spectrum of human activity.  I don&#8217;t claim that the subdivision given here is <em>definitive</em>, but that it&#8217;s <em>useful</em>.  Consider it a set of basis vectors into the space of human activity.  Different basis sets are helpful for reasoning about different problems, but they all describe the same space.</span>    </p>

<p><img width="345" height="103" src="p/taxonomy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p id="p74" onmouseover="pIn(74)" onmouseout="pOut(74)"><a id="a74" class="anchor" href="#p74"># </a>At the present, software can&#8217;t do much for physical needs&#8212;if your avatar eats a sandwich, you remain hungry.  But people are increasingly shifting their intellectual activities to the virtual world of the computer.  This suggests three general reasons why a person will turn to software:</p>

<ul>
<li>To learn.</li>
<li>To create.</li>
<li>To communicate.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p75" onmouseover="pIn(75)" onmouseout="pOut(75)"><a id="a75" class="anchor" href="#p75"># </a>I propose that software can be classified according to which of these needs it serves.  I will call these categories <em>information</em> software, <em>manipulation</em> software, and <em>communication</em> software.</p>

<p id="p76" onmouseover="pIn(76)" onmouseout="pOut(76)"><a id="a76" class="anchor" href="#p76"># </a><strong>Information software</strong> serves the human urge to learn.
<span class="sidenote"><img width="200" height="107" src="p/information_model.png" alt="" /></span>
A person uses information software to <b>construct and manipulate a model that is internal to the mind</b>&#8212;a mental representation of information.  Good information software encourages the user to ask and answer questions, make comparisons, and draw conclusions.  A person would use recipe software, for example, to decide what to cook for dinner.  She would learn about various dishes (where &#8220;learning&#8221; could be as informal as a quick skim for something tasty that contains ingredients on hand), compare her options, and make her decision.  In effect, she is constructing an internal understanding of culinary possibilities, and mentally prodding this model to reveal the optimal choice.  It&#8217;s the same effect she would hope to achieve by consulting a recipe <em>book</em>.</p>

<p id="p77" onmouseover="pIn(77)" onmouseout="pOut(77)"><a id="a77" class="anchor" href="#p77"># </a><strong>Manipulation software</strong> serves the human urge to create.
<span class="sidenote"><img width="200" height="127" src="p/manipulation_model.png" alt="" /></span>
A person uses manipulation software to <b>construct and manipulate a model external to herself</b>&#8212;a virtual object represented within the computer, or a remote physical object.  Some examples include software for drawing, writing, music composition, architectural design, engineering design, and robot control.  Manipulation software can be considered a virtual <em>tool</em>&#8212;like a paintbrush or typewriter or bandsaw, it is used as an interface between creator and artifact.</p>

<p id="p78" onmouseover="pIn(78)" onmouseout="pOut(78)"><a id="a78" class="anchor" href="#p78"># </a><strong>Communication software</strong> serves the human urge to communicate.
<span class="sidenote"><img width="200" height="121" src="p/communication_model.png" alt="" /></span>
A person uses communication software to <b>construct and manipulate an internal model that is shared with others</b>&#8212;an understanding synchronized across multiple minds.  Examples include software for email, group discussions (whether voice, video, or text), and collaborative working.  In terms of raw mechanics, communication can be thought of as <em>creating</em> a response to information <em>learned</em>&#8212;that is, the external model manipulated by the speaker is the internal model learned by the listener.  Thus, this paper will simply treat communication software as manipulation software and information software glued together, and mention it no further.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* This dismissal is rather disingenuous&#8212;communication software is fundamentally unlike the other two because its user is a <em>group</em>, and a group as a whole can have different goals than any of its constituents individually.  The considerations of social software design are well beyond the scope of this paper, but see <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>&#8217;s essays, particularly <a href="http://shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html">Social Software and the Politics of Groups</a> (2003).</span>      This design approach is widespread&#8212;email software typically has separate reading and writing modes; messageboards similarly segregate browsing and posting.</p>

<h2 id="manipulation_software_design_is_hard">Manipulation software design is hard</h2>

<p id="p79" onmouseover="pIn(79)" onmouseout="pOut(79)"><a id="a79" class="anchor" href="#p79"># </a>Manipulation software generally displays a representation of an object&#8212;the model&#8212;which the user directly manipulates with pseudo-mechanical affordances.  Because manipulation is the domain of industrial design, manipulation software emphasizes industrial design aspects.</p>

<p id="p80" onmouseover="pIn(80)" onmouseout="pOut(80)"><a id="a80" class="anchor" href="#p80"># </a>Consider a tool for laying out a small newspaper.  The user will spend most of her time performing a number of pseudo-physical operations&#8212;writing, drawing, cutting, moving, rotating, stretching, cropping, layering&#8212;within a virtual space.  The primary design challenge, just as with any industrial design, is to provide affordances that make these mechanical operations <em>available</em>, <em>understandable</em>, and <em>comfortable</em>.  However, in a physical space, each operation would use a specialized tool.   Designing a &#8220;mega-tool&#8221; that cleanly incorporates all operations (and flattens them into two dimensions, and uses only the gestures &#8220;click&#8221; and &#8220;drag&#8221;) is a significant challenge indeed.</p>

<p id="p81" onmouseover="pIn(81)" onmouseout="pOut(81)"><a id="a81" class="anchor" href="#p81"># </a>Although manipulation is the focus, good manipulation software must provide superb visualization as well.  This establishes the feedback loop that is critical for all creative activity&#8212;the manipulator must see the effects of her manipulation.  Thus, manipulation software design is also a significant graphic design challenge.</p>

<p id="p82" onmouseover="pIn(82)" onmouseout="pOut(82)"><a id="a82" class="anchor" href="#p82"># </a>For example, the newspaper editor needs to see what a page looks like&#8212;close-up, from a distance, and in relation to other pages&#8212;and how it <em>would</em> look in a variety of other configurations.  She wants to see misspelled words, lines that are poorly justified or hyphenated, and widows and orphans.  She wants to see columns that are short or overlong, and how they can be corrected by changing column width or leading.  She wants to know what stories and ads are still on the table, their sizes, and how they can be fit in.  She wants to know how recently and how often stories about a given topic have run, and how readers have responded.  She wants to know past response to a given ad, as a function of the topics or authors of the stories it was coupled with.  Finally, the presentation of all this information must not distract the editor from the primary task of manipulating the layout.</p>

<p id="p83" onmouseover="pIn(83)" onmouseout="pOut(83)"><a id="a83" class="anchor" href="#p83"># </a>Furthermore, the industrial and graphic designs in manipulation software must be in intimate synergy, since it is the graphic design which describes how the object can be manipulated&#8212;the mechanical affordances are graphical constructs.  Even more graphically challenging is manipulation of abstract objects, such as music or financial data, where the graphical representation must show not only what can be done with it, but <em>what it is</em> in the first place.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* As opposed to painting software, for instance, where the graphical representation can be the artifact itself.  This is not a pipe, but it&#8217;s close enough.</span>    </p>

<p id="p84" onmouseover="pIn(84)" onmouseout="pOut(84)"><a id="a84" class="anchor" href="#p84"># </a>Because of these intertwined design challenges, the design of excellent manipulation software is <em>unbelievably</em> difficult, and mustn&#8217;t be underestimated.  Fortunately, for an enormous class of software, manipulation is not only largely unnecessary, but best avoided.</p>

<p id="p85" onmouseover="pIn(85)" onmouseout="pOut(85)"><a id="a85" class="anchor" href="#p85"># </a>J.C.R. Licklider once examined how he spent his research time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="p45" onmouseover="pIn(45)" onmouseout="pOut(45)"><a id="a45" class="anchor" href="#p45"># </a>In the spring and summer of 1957&#8230; I tried to keep track of what one moderately technical person [myself] actually did during the hours he regarded as devoted to work&#8230;  About 85 per cent of my &#8220;thinking&#8221; time was spent getting into a position to think, to make a decision, to learn something I needed to know. Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it. Hours went into the plotting of graphs, and other hours into instructing an assistant how to plot. When the graphs were finished, the relations were obvious at once, but the plotting had to be done in order to make them so&#8230;  Throughout the period I examined, in short, my &#8220;thinking&#8221; time was devoted mainly to activities that were essentially clerical or mechanical: searching, calculating, plotting, transforming, determining the logical or dynamic consequences of a set of assumptions or hypotheses, preparing the way for a decision or an insight.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* J.C.R.

They keep track of a dozen simultaneous conversations in private correspondence, and maybe hundreds in public arenas.  They browse for a book for Mom, a coat for Dad, and a car for Junior.  They look for an apartment to live in, and a bed for that apartment, and perhaps a companion for the bed.  They ask when the movie is playing, and how to drive to the theater, and where to eat before the movie, and where to get cash before they eat.  They ask for numbers, from simple sums to financial projections.  They ask about money, from stock quote histories to bank account balances.

To me, it is about combining, correlating, and visualizing a vast collection of information.  I want to understand what I have planned for tonight, what my friends have planned, what&#8217;s going on downtown, what&#8217;s showing when at the movie theater, how late the pizza place is open, and which days they are closed.  I want to see my pattern of working late before milestones, and how that extrapolates to future milestones.  I want to see how all of this information interrelates, make connections, and ultimately make a decision about what to do when.  Entering a dentist appointment is just a tedious minor detail, and would even be <em>unnecessary</em> if the software could figure it out from my dentist&#8217;s confirmation email.

If I give up extra guacamole on my daily burrito, will I be able to buy a new laptop?  What is my pattern of Christmas spending, and will I have to cut back if I don&#8217;t take any jobs for a month?  If I buy a hybrid car, how much will I save on gas?

At the best retailers, this manipulation is made as brief as possible.</p>

<p id="p93" onmouseover="pIn(93)" onmouseout="pOut(93)"><a id="a93" class="anchor" href="#p93"># </a>Even consider reading email.  Most current designs revolve around the manipulation of individual messages&#8212;reading them one-by-one, searching them, sorting them, filing them, deleting them.  But the <em>purpose</em> of reading email has nothing to do with the messages themselves.  I read email to keep a complex set of mental understandings up-to-date&#8212;the statuses of personal conversations, of projects at work, of invitations and appointments and business transactions and packages in the mail.  That this information happens to be parceled out in timestamped chunks of text is an implementation detail of the communication process.

Meanwhile, a graphic sidesteps human shortcomings:  the one-dimensional, uncontrollable auditory system, the relatively sluggish motor system, the mind&#8217;s limited capacity to comprehend hidden mechanisms.

Important features such as crossings are <em>emphasized</em> simply because the eye is naturally drawn toward line intersections.

This is a problem of surface, but not a superficial problem.  The main cause, I believe, is that many software designers feel they are designing a machine.  Their foremost concern is behavior&#8212;what the software <em>does</em>.  They start by asking:  What functions must the software perform?  What commands must it accept?  What parameters can be adjusted?  (In the case of websites:  What pages must there be?  How are they linked together?  What are the dynamic features?)

<b>I suggest that the design of information software should be approached initially and primarily as a graphic design project.</b>  The foremost concern should be appearance&#8212;what and how information is presented.  The designer should ask:  What <em>is</em> relevant information?  What questions will the viewer ask?  What situations will she want to compare?  What decision is she trying to make?  How can the data be presented most effectively?  How can the visual vocabulary and techniques of graphic design be employed to direct the user&#8217;s eyes to the solution?  The designer must start by considering what the software <em>looks like</em>, because the user is using it to learn, and she learns by looking at it.</p>

This is reasonable in many situations where the user&#8217;s context is fairly static, changing slowly over the short term.  For example, if yesterday, the user looked for one-bedroom apartments in North Berkeley, she is is probably still interested in one-bedroom apartments in North Berkeley today.

Often, not even this is bothered with.</span>      This stateful conceptual model mimics physical reality, and can be comfortable if the user cares enough about the software&#8217;s state to keep her own mental state in sync.  However, this is often not the case with information software, especially software that is consulted intermittently.  (If you put down a newspaper for a few hours, you won&#8217;t be distressed to find it on a different page when you return.  You probably won&#8217;t even notice.  On the other hand, you would be delighted if you often came back to find it on exactly the page you wanted to read.)

For example, in a music library, as the user chooses several bluegrass songs in a row, the software can graphically emphasize other songs in this genre.  With further confidence, it might consider de-emphasizing or omitting songs outside of the genre.  As another example, consider a user who requests information about &#8220;Lightwave,&#8221; then about &#8220;Bryce,&#8221; then &#8220;Blender.&#8221;  These terms have many meanings individually, but as a group they are clearly names of 3D rendering software packages.  A subsequent search for &#8220;Maya,&#8221; another 3D package, should not display information about the ancient civilization.  In fact, information about Maya could be presented automatically.</p>

As an example of general pattern modeling, consider a person who, as a byproduct of traveling to work, always checks the train schedule from Berkeley to San Francisco in the morning, and San Francisco to Berkeley in the evening.  If the software can discover and model this pattern, it can present the appropriate information at each time without the user having to request it.  When she looks in the morning, she sees by default the San Francisco-bound schedule; in the evening, the Berkeley-bound schedule.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Again, this may sound daunting to an engineer.

The software, in turn, inputs the user&#8217;s manipulation request, updates the model, and displays the updated representation.  With good feedback and an effective means of &#8220;speaking&#8221; to the software, this process can cycle smoothly and rapidly.  It mimics the experience of working with a physical tool.</p>

<ul>
<li><p id="p7" onmouseover="pIn(7)" onmouseout="pOut(7)"><a id="a7" class="anchor" href="#p7"># </a>The user has to already know <em>what</em> she wants in order to ask for it.

Further, the user might prefer to learn information while using her hands for other purposes, such as writing or eating or stroking a cat.  Each time software demands the user&#8217;s hands, this activity must be interrupted.

As suggested by the above redesigns of the train timetable, bookstore, and movie listings, many questions can be answered simply through clever, information-rich graphic design.  Interaction should be used <em>judiciously</em> and <em>sparingly</em>, only when the environment and history provide insufficient context to construct an acceptable graphic.</p>

Most of the user&#8217;s interaction will then consist of <em>correcting</em> (or confirming) the software&#8217;s predictions.  This is generally less stressful than constructing the entire context from scratch.</p>

<p id="p174" onmouseover="pIn(174)" onmouseout="pOut(174)"><a id="a174" class="anchor" href="#p174"># </a>For example, Google Maps offers both absolute navigation (typing in an address) and relative navigation (panning and zooming the current map).

Ironically, her own neighborhood is the <em>least</em> likely place she&#8217;ll need mapped.</span>     A better design might start at the last place the user looked (last-value prediction), with a nearby list of locations predicted by history (recently visited or manually bookmarked) and the environment (addresses extracted from email, open websites, and calendar software).  A reasonable starting point would almost always be a click away, and from there, the user could use relative navigation (dragging and zooming) or simply &#8220;navigate&#8221; by eye if the graphic is detailed enough.  <span class="sidenote">Conceptually, a prediction list might itself be considered relative navigation, as a set of &#8220;shortcuts&#8221; through the data space.</span></p>

This might answer most of the user&#8217;s questions without any interaction at all.</p>

<p id="p176" onmouseover="pIn(176)" onmouseout="pOut(176)"><a id="a176" class="anchor" href="#p176"># </a><strong>Tight feedback loops.</strong>  Salen and Zimmerman offer a game design perspective on a principle that is crucial for all interactive software:</p>

  <p id="p47" onmouseover="pIn(47)" onmouseout="pOut(47)"><a id="a47" class="anchor" href="#p47"># </a>If you shoot an asteroid while playing a computer game and the asteroid does not change in any way, you are not going to know if you actually hit it or not.  If you do not receive feedback that indicates you are on the right track, the action you took will have very little meaning.  On the other hand, if you shoot an asteroid and you hear the sound of impact, or the asteroid shudders violently, or it explodes (or all three!) then the game has effectively communicated the outcome of your action.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262240459">Rules of Play</a> (2003), p35.</span>    </p>
</blockquote>

<p id="p177" onmouseover="pIn(177)" onmouseout="pOut(177)"><a id="a177" class="anchor" href="#p177"># </a>This principle is universal.  If the user clicks a checkbox and <em>nothing happens</em>, her action is rendered ambiguous or even meaningless.  She cannot evaluate a response and let it guide her next action.  In terms of Crawford&#8217;s conversation metaphor, the software is failing to speak back&#8212;she is shouting into the wind.</p>

<p id="p178" onmouseover="pIn(178)" onmouseout="pOut(178)"><a id="a178" class="anchor" href="#p178"># </a>For information software in particular, all interaction specifies context.

<p id="p179" onmouseover="pIn(179)" onmouseout="pOut(179)"><a id="a179" class="anchor" href="#p179"># </a>Any web form with a &#8220;submit&#8221; button or dialog box with an &#8220;accept&#8221; button fails this point.  Google Maps offers reasonable feedback during relative navigation, but none during absolute navigation, such as typing in an address.  Even a simple predictive auto-complete would be helpful, but consider the possibilities suggested by Ben Fry&#8217;s <a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/">zipdecode</a> applet.  (First click &#8220;zoom&#8221; in the lower-right, then type in numbers.)  Imagine honing in on familiar areas simply by typing the first few digits of a zip code&#8212;type &#8220;9&#8221; to immediately zoom into the US west coast, followed by &#8220;4&#8221; to zoom into the SF bay area and then &#8220;5&#8221; for the east bay.  Because of the immediate feedback, the user can stop typing when she gets close enough, and use relative navigation from there.</p>

<p id="p180" onmouseover="pIn(180)" onmouseout="pOut(180)"><a id="a180" class="anchor" href="#p180"># </a>Much current software is interaction-heavy and information-weak.  I can think of a few reasons for this.</p>

<p id="p181" onmouseover="pIn(181)" onmouseout="pOut(181)"><a id="a181" class="anchor" href="#p181"># </a>First, our current UI paradigm was invented in a different technological era.  The initial Macintosh, for example, had no network, no mass storage, and little inter-program communication.  Thus, it knew little of its <em>environment</em> beyond the date and time, and memory was too precious to record significant <em>history</em>.  Interaction was <em>all it had</em>, so that&#8217;s what its designers used.  And because the computer didn&#8217;t have much to inform anyone of, most of the software at the time was manipulation software&#8212;magic versions of the typewriter, easel, and ledger-book.  Twenty years and an internet explosion later, software has much more to say, but an inadequate language with which to say it.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Make no mistake, I revere <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> pioneers such as Alan Kay and Bill Atkinson, but they were inventing rules for a different game.  Today, their windows and menus are like buggy whips on a car.  (Although Alan Kay clearly <em>foresaw</em> today&#8217;s technological environment, even in the mid-&#8217;70s.  See &#8220;A Simple Vision of the Future&#8221; in his fascinating <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org/smalltalk/TheEarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk_V.html">Early History of Smalltalk</a> (1993).)</span> 
 </p>

<p id="p182" onmouseover="pIn(182)" onmouseout="pOut(182)"><a id="a182" class="anchor" href="#p182"># </a>A second reason why modern software is dominated by mechanical metaphors is that, for the people who create software, the computer <em>is</em> a machine.  The programmer lives in manipulation mode; she drives her computer as if it were a car.  Thus, she inadvertently produces software that must be operated like a machine, even if it is <em>used</em> as a newspaper or book.  Worse, the people who design platforms and <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> toolkits are even more prone to this perspective, since they work at a lower level.  The application software designer is then almost forced into a mechanical model by the design environment.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Apple&#8217;s Interface Builder, for example, makes it simple to place buttons, sliders, and blocks of text.  Dynamic graphics, the cornerstone of information software, must be tediously programmed with low-level constructs.</span>    </p>

<p id="p183" onmouseover="pIn(183)" onmouseout="pOut(183)"><a id="a183" class="anchor" href="#p183"># </a>Even software that starts out information-rich and interaction-simple tends to accumulate wasteful manipulation as features are added over successive versions.  It&#8217;s easier on both the designer and the programmer to plug in another menu item and dialog box than to redesign a dynamic graphic, and sometimes it&#8217;s justified as a less jarring change for the user.  After ten versions, the software can grow into a monstrosity, with the user spending more time pulling down menus than studying and learning information.</p>

That is, the user wants to compare trips along the time dimension, but not the space dimensions.

Some additional graphical touches help bring the design together.  The sentence is contained within a cartoon speech bubble which, beyond simply looking cute, implies that the activity pertains to speech, and points via the tail to the button which spawned it and the trip to which it refers.  More importantly, if a voice announcement is activated, the button&#8217;s icon changes to an active speaker.

This avoids a &#8220;hidden mode&#8221; problem by providing a clear visual indication of where the voice is coming from and how to turn it off.</p>

A single book might cost as much as a farm.  Books were also exquisite works of art, carefully lettered in calligraphy, lavishly illustrated and decorated.  In the 1440s, Johann Gutenberg&#8217;s movable type press boosted book production over a <em>thousand-fold</em>, making books affordable (and literacy worthwhile, and political awareness possible) for the average person for the first time.  Fortunately, Gutenberg and contemporary printers were exceptionally devoted to the art form, and took great pains to preserve the quality of the hand-lettered page.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Gutenberg&#8217;s emulation of calligraphy was so accurate, his bibles were sold as handmade manuscripts in Paris.

He would demonstrate to a homemaker how his vacuum cleaner or iron was designed to reduce fatigue and cramping.  He would demonstrate to a farmer how his machinery was designed to eliminate the finger-severing accidents that were, to that point, distressingly common.

Today, software consumers demand technological features because software marketing <em>presents</em> features.  Consumers ignore design because marketing ignores design.

It is better to look for interest and talent in communicating with people, not with technology, since people don&#8217;t change nearly as fast.</span>      I believe that ideal candidates for software design are those who have achieved mastery of information graphics in other mediums.  There may be multitudes of artists, currently drawing business graphics or maps or comics, who could excel at information software design if they had any idea that it was a legitimate artistic field.  Recent years have brought a wealth of beautiful amateur websites, created by visually-oriented people dabbling in the only sort of software design accessible to them.

They learn about cognitive and behavioral psychology, and explore how users experience products.  They follow the entire production process:  researching the needs of the target markets; sketching ideas and proposals; drawing detailed renderings; designing virtual 3D models; constructing physical models out of clay, plastic, and fiberglass; constructing a functional mechanical solution; designing logos and retail packaging.  They learn to devise artistic solutions to problems, to think creatively and think critically, to invent concepts and critique those of others.

If I write you a letter, my tools are pen and paper, and your platform is knowledge of my written language.  If I broadcast a radio signal, my tools are a microphone and transmitter, and your platform is a radio receiver.  In general, my tools are whatever I use to make the thing I hand off to you.

Hoare, <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/opinions/p75-hoare.pdf">The Emperor&#8217;s Old Clothes</a> Turing Award lecture (1980), p81.</span>
From a practical (and historical) standpoint, we can assume that <em>no complex specification will be implemented exactly</em>.  This, in itself, is not a problem.  However, multiple, decentralized implementations of a complex specification will be incorrect in different ways.  A platform consisting of the union of all possible implementations is thus arbitrarily <em>unreliable</em>&#8212;the designer can have no assurance of what a recipient actually receives.  <b>For a platform to be reliable, it must either have a single implementation, or be so utterly simple that it can be implemented uniformly.</b>  If we assume a practical need for open, freely implementable standards, the only option is simplicity.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* <acronym title="Portable Operating System Interface">POSIX</acronym>, Java, and newer web standards (<acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>) are some attempts at universal platforms (for various domains) that have proven too complex to implement uniformly.  In each case, the power of the platform is effectively constricted to some simple, reliable <em>subset</em>, and enormous time is wasted designing around incompatibilities.  By contrast, JPEG, MP3, and modern CPU instruction sets are universally dependable, because much of the complexity is placed at the encoding tool, not the decoding platform.  (Almost a century ago, a similar justification was used to reject single-sideband public radio.)  The complex Perl and Flash platforms are dependable only because they have centralized implementations.</span>

(This is sometimes called the &#8220;data is code&#8221; equivalence.)  But the limitations of the JPEG platform result in severely lobotomized &#8220;programs&#8221;&#8212;they cannot animate, respond to context, incorporate new compression techniques, or otherwise take any advantage of the <em>computer</em> beyond what JPEG explicitly allows.

This results in ridiculously large feedback loops&#8212;seeing the effect of a change might take a day instead of a second.

For now, we will just handle the color and label.  We draw a picture, take a snapshot, and indicate the data properties that it corresponds to:</p>

The tool will learn and use this rule, provided no other example contradicts it.</p>

<p id="p276" onmouseover="pIn(276)" onmouseout="pOut(276)"><a id="a276" class="anchor" href="#p276"># </a>We now teach the tool how to respond to the &#8220;Line&#8221; property.</p>

The data is exactly the same, except for the &#8220;Line&#8221; property.  Thus, the tool infers that each given value of the &#8220;Line&#8221; property corresponds to a particular hue adjustment.</p>

<p id="p278" onmouseover="pIn(278)" onmouseout="pOut(278)"><a id="a278" class="anchor" href="#p278"># </a>At this point, the tool should understand how to draw a <strong>Train</strong> for any arbitrary data set, as long as &#8220;Line&#8221; is within the provided domain.

We will use two data properties.  &#8220;Now&#8221; refers to the current time, and &#8220;Time&#8221; refers to the start or end of the trip.  Here are our first two snapshots:</p>

The tool will easily infer that the first row corresponds to &#8220;Time&#8221; (again, as long it doesn&#8217;t contradict further examples).  The second row is more problematic.  The tool infers linear relations when given two points, so our examples indicate this relation:</p>

<p id="p283" onmouseover="pIn(283)" onmouseout="pOut(283)"><a id="a283" class="anchor" href="#p283"># </a>The simplest non-trivial relation now depends on the difference between &#8220;Now&#8221; and &#8220;Time&#8221;, which is correct:<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* To understand how the tool might figure this out, let us take f(x,y) to be the number in the text label, and x and y to be our two data properties (here expressed as minutes since 3:00, although any units and origin will work).  The three snapshots give us these constraints:<br /><br />
f(0,1) = 1 <br />
f(0,119) = 119 <br />
f(-60,-59) = 1 <br /><br /> 
One of the simplest and most naturally-occurring functions of two variables is linear combination:<br /><br />
f(x,y) = ax + by + c <br /><br />
Solving for the coefficients gives us <br /><br />
a = -1,  b = 1,  c = 0 <br /><br />
Because linear combination results in such simple coefficients, the tool will have high confidence in this inference, and will use it unless contradicted by some other example.</span>

<p id="p286" onmouseover="pIn(286)" onmouseout="pOut(286)"><a id="a286" class="anchor" href="#p286"># </a>The blue extrapolation is desired.  The tool can probably infer it, since it results in an arguably simpler relation.  (The red interpretation makes &#8220;in 2 hours&#8221; a special case, whereas the blue interpretation understands it as part of a general rule.)  But if the tool infers incorrectly, the designer can easily correct it.  (How so will be discussed below.)</p>

<p id="p304" onmouseover="pIn(304)" onmouseout="pOut(304)"><a id="a304" class="anchor" href="#p304"># </a>However, this raises a concern about editing.  An advantage of abstraction is that it localizes common properties, so widespread changes can be made with a single edit.  What if the designer decides that a <strong>Train</strong> should have square corners instead of rounded?  Having to individually edit each of the snapshots is unacceptable&#8212;such a burden would squelch experimentation.</p>

<p id="p305" onmouseover="pIn(305)" onmouseout="pOut(305)"><a id="a305" class="anchor" href="#p305"># </a>Instead, the designer simply <em>selects</em> the snapshots she wants changed, and proceeds to edit <em>one</em> of them.

If we allow a component&#8217;s parameters (the function&#8217;s &#8220;arguments&#8221;) to themselves be dynamic graphics instead of merely text, and provide a means of graphically extracting part of a parameter and recursing on the rest, this language should be as expressive and powerful as any textual functional language.</span>   </p>

Good information software will attempt to predict current context by discovering patterns in past contexts.  Although such application software is rare, there is nothing novel or exotic about the algorithms required.  The computer science discipline devoted to this subject is called &#8220;<b>machine learning</b>&#8221; or &#8220;learning systems,&#8221; and several decades of research have produced a variety of algorithms for modeling and predicting behavior.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Tom Mitchell&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0070428077">Machine Learning</a> (1997) gives a good introductory overview to the basic algorithms.  Russell and Norvig&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137903952">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a> (2003) covers learning within a much broader context, but is less focused and concise.</span>   </p>

<p id="p332" onmouseover="pIn(332)" onmouseout="pOut(332)"><a id="a332" class="anchor" href="#p332"># </a>Consider the example presented earlier of a train trip planner that predicts the route that the user wants to see.  There are typically daily or weekly patterns to a person&#8217;s local travel schedule.  A planner that models these patterns could automatically present the user with appropriate information, eliminating most interaction.</p>

<p id="p333" onmouseover="pIn(333)" onmouseout="pOut(333)"><a id="a333" class="anchor" href="#p333"># </a>As a demonstration, I implemented this behavior with the very simple probabilistic algorithm described below:<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* You can see the Lua <a href="predictor.lua">source code</a> for the algorithm and test simulator.</span> 
 </p>

<p id="p334" onmouseover="pIn(334)" onmouseout="pOut(334)"><a id="a334" class="anchor" href="#p334"># </a><strong>History collection.</strong>  Each time the user indicates interest in a particular route, it is recorded in a history with the date and time.
<span class="sidenote"><img width="191" height="106" src="p/predictor_history.png" alt="" /></span>
The user indicates interest either by explicitly switching the planner to display a route, or by looking at the planner and then looking away, indicating that the shown route is still interesting.</p>

<p id="p335" onmouseover="pIn(335)" onmouseout="pOut(335)"><a id="a335" class="anchor" href="#p335"># </a><strong>Prediction.</strong>  When the user looks at the planner, each history entry &#8220;votes&#8221; for its route with a certain weight, and the route with the largest total weight is displayed.  Each entry&#8217;s weight is a product of three factors, which depend on the time, the day of the week, and the age of the history entry.</p>

<ul>
<li><p id="p22" onmouseover="pIn(22)" onmouseout="pOut(22)"><a id="a22" class="anchor" href="#p22"># </a><span class="sidenote"><img width="221" height="189" src="p/predictor_time_both.png" alt="" /></span>
<strong>Time.</strong>  If the time is 9:00, the user&#8217;s route at 9:10 yesterday is very relevant.  What the user did at 10:00 is not quite so relevant, and her 12:00 activity is probably unrelated.  Thus, each vote is weighted by a window around the time of the history entry.</p>

<p id="p23" onmouseover="pIn(23)" onmouseout="pOut(23)"><a id="a23" class="anchor" href="#p23"># </a>Typically, if the user is preparing to catch a train, she won&#8217;t just look once at the planner and memorize the time.  She will glance at the planner frequently over a span of time.  Each of these looks should not count as an individual vote.  Instead, the entire span of checking is coalesced into a single history entry, with a widened time window.  (Also, throughout these frequent check-ups, the user sees only last-value prediction.  Learning prediction is only used if some time has passed since the previous look.)</p></li>

<strong>Day of the week.</strong>  A user will typically exhibit a superposition of daily patterns, such as going to and from work, and weekly patterns, such as cello practice every Tuesday.  To allow for both, history entries from a different weekday are allowed to vote, but have a smaller weight.  The bleed across days allows the algorithm to learn daily patterns faster, but because other days are penalized, weekly patterns can be learned as well.  Saturday and Sunday are independent from weekdays and from each other.</p></li>

<strong>Age.</strong>  Older history entries are given less weight, and eventually are forgotten.  This makes the algorithm <em>adaptive</em>.  If the user adopts a new pattern, such as switching jobs or joining the Thursday-night knitting circle, the algorithm is able to keep up, instead of having to be manually reset.</p></li>
</ul>

<p id="p336" onmouseover="pIn(336)" onmouseout="pOut(336)"><a id="a336" class="anchor" href="#p336"># </a>Finally, the most recent route is given a bonus vote.  This causes the algorithm to default to last-value prediction if there is no compelling reason to do otherwise.</p>

 - The ``email digester'' translates Email objects into several other objects, one of which contains the body of the email as a Text object.
 - The ``text digester'' translates Text objects into Keyword objects by looking for important words.  One of the words it finds is ``pizza.''
 - A component provided by ``EpicurioCity.com'' translates Keywords into Restaurants, if the keyword corresponds to a restaurant name or cuisine.  It recognizes ``pizza,'' and translates it into Restaurant objects representing pizza places. [How it knows what area to look for restaurants will be described shortly.]
 - The map view requests topics with a location property.  The nominated topic (the Email) has been translated into objects that have a location property (Restaurants), so the platform gives them to the map to display.

This is necessary for efficiency reasons, but also explains how EpicurioCity knows the area to look for restaurants&#8212;the map actually requests objects with locations <em>around a particular area</em>, and EpicurioCity then attempts to produce objects that match this type.  It also explains how EpicurioCity knows how many objects to produce from its almost infinite collection&#8212;it produces objects as long as the map consumes them.</p>

It would then get picked up by EpicurioCity and translated into restaurants, and these would show up on the map.  Thus, we have the remarkable emergent behavior of being able to look up pizza places simply by <em>typing the word &#8220;pizza&#8221; anywhere on the computer</em>.</p>

Partial or tenuous matches can be translated with low confidence instead of omitted.  For example, a movie translator from CelluDroid.com might translate &#8220;pizza&#8221; into the film &#8220;Pizza Cato: The String Cheese Connection,&#8221; but because the name is only partially matched and the context of the consumed object contains no references to movies, the confidence would be low.</p></li>

Twenty years later, despite thousand-fold improvements along every technological dimension, the concepts behind today&#8217;s interfaces are almost <em>identical</em> to those in the initial Mac.

I believe that in order for a personal information device to be viable in the long term, it must satisfy two conflicting criteria:  portability and readability.</p>

<ul>
<li><p id="p38" onmouseover="pIn(38)" onmouseout="pOut(38)"><a id="a38" class="anchor" href="#p38"># </a><strong>Portability.</strong>  Consider today&#8217;s ubiquitous information device&#8212;the book.  We have the technology to manufacture 5000-page desk-sized tomes, but despite the high information content, such books are rare.  The reason is simply that they can&#8217;t be carried around.  As people increasingly expect information on demand, portability will become ever more critical.  Today, people can talk to anyone on the planet by reaching into a pocket; tomorrow&#8217;s information device must be just as accessible.  Like a wallet and keys, the computer will be dropped into the pocket or purse before leaving the house.<span class="asterisk">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Ideally, it will even supplant both wallet and keys.</span>     This implies light weight and small volume.</p></li>
<li><p id="p39" onmouseover="pIn(39)" onmouseout="pOut(39)"><a id="a39" class="anchor" href="#p39"># </a><strong>Readability.</strong>  Consider again the book.  We have the technology to produce books smaller than a business card, but despite the improved portability, such books are also rare.  The supremely-portable postage-stamp-sized book is non-existent.  The catch:  <b>Although technology miniaturizes, the human eyespan remains a fundamental constant.</b>  In order to compete with the book, tomorrow&#8217;s information device must provide a book-sized surface area.  Anything less cannot be read and skimmed comfortably, and cannot support spatially-distributed information graphics.</p></li>
</ul>

<p id="p381" onmouseover="pIn(381)" onmouseout="pOut(381)"><a id="a381" class="anchor" href="#p381"># </a>To resolve these contrasting size constraints, I predict a computer the size and thickness of a sheet of paper.  Like paper, its entire surface is a graphical display.  When in use, it is rigid; when not in use, it collapses and can be folded or rolled up (or crumpled!) and tucked into a pocket or purse.</p>

<ul>

Dynamic graphics with print resolution will open up a world of possibilities for detailed information graphics which are impossible today in either medium.</p></li>
<li><p id="p41" onmouseover="pIn(41)" onmouseout="pOut(41)"><a id="a41" class="anchor" href="#p41"># </a><strong>Environment.</strong>  Because the user will carry this device everywhere, the device&#8217;s environment will literally be the user&#8217;s own.  Assuming a sufficient networking model, the device will be able to sense an enormous amount of information from the environment&#8212;geographical location, physical surroundings (streets, stores, transportation options, entertainment options), social surroundings (friends, strangers with interests in common, strangers who can serve a need), and more.  The device will have a far better sense of the user&#8217;s environment than the user herself.</p></li>
<li><p id="p42" onmouseover="pIn(42)" onmouseout="pOut(42)"><a id="a42" class="anchor" href="#p42"># </a><strong>History.</strong>  Since its inception, electronic storage has exponentially increased in density and decreased in cost.  We can fully expect tomorrow&#8217;s device to have onboard capacities that stagger modern sensibilities.  But, perhaps more importantly, ubiquitous network access will make memory effectively <em>unlimited</em>.  The device will have the means to remember everything the user has ever done and every environment in which she did it.  With such a tremendous history and sense of the environment, software will have an unprecedented potential to predict the user&#8217;s current context.</p></li>

But none of these mechanisms will ever approach the sheer amount of information that can be absorbed by the eye.  No matter what new interactive technology comes along, the bandwidth between the device and the user will remain not merely asymmetric, but utterly lopsided.</p></li>

Prior to joining Apple, I was designing <a href="http://worrydream.com/Substroke/">Substroke</a>, a visual language for drawing dynamic graphics.  (It was inspired by, but only loosely based on, the design tool discussed above.)  Previous interesting projects include the apparel design tool <a href="http://www.click-shirt.com/">ClickShirt</a>, and several <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan05/articles/alesismicron.htm">musical instruments</a> for Alesis.</p>

<p id="p412" onmouseover="pIn(412)" onmouseout="pOut(412)"><a id="a412" class="anchor" href="#p412"># </a>I believe that mankind&#8217;s ability to avert global catastrophes will hinge on the design of excellent information software (so scientists can see the problems) and manipulation software (so engineers can create solutions).  Accordingly, I&#8217;m interested in coming up with new models and tools for designing this software and presenting this information.  <span class="sidenote">I actually have no interest whatsoever in online retailers.  They just make for good examples.</span></p>

  <p id="p48" onmouseover="pIn(48)" onmouseout="pOut(48)"><a id="a48" class="anchor" href="#p48"># </a>In the early days, I was solving one problem after another after another; a fair number were successful and there were a few failures. I went home one Friday after finishing a problem, and curiously enough I wasn&#8217;t happy; I was depressed. I could see life being a long sequence of one problem after another after another. After quite a while of thinking I decided, &#8220;No, I should be in the mass production of a variable product. I should be concerned with all of next year&#8217;s problems, not just the one in front of my face.&#8221; By changing the question I still got the same kind of results or better, but I changed things and did important work. I attacked the major problem&#8212;How do I conquer machines and do all of next year&#8217;s problems when I don&#8217;t know what they are going to be? How do I prepare for it? How do I do this one so I&#8217;ll be on top of it? How do I obey Newton&#8217;s rule? He said, &#8220;If I have seen further than others, it is because I&#8217;ve stood on the shoulders of giants.&#8221; These days we stand on each other&#8217;s feet!</p>
  
  <p id="p49" onmouseover="pIn(49)" onmouseout="pOut(49)"><a id="a49" class="anchor" href="#p49"># </a>You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will indeed say, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve stood on so and so&#8217;s shoulders and I saw further.&#8221; The essence of science is cumulative. By changing a problem slightly you can often do great work rather than merely good work. Instead of attacking isolated problems, <b>I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.</b><br />

<blockquote>
  <p id="p51" onmouseover="pIn(51)" onmouseout="pOut(51)"><a id="a51" class="anchor" href="#p51"># </a>When I first prepared this particular talk &#8230; I realized that my usual approach is usually critical.  That is, a lot of the things that I do, that most people do, are because they hate something somebody else has done, or they hate that something hasn&#8217;t been done.  And I realized that informed criticism has completely been done in by the web.  Because the web has produced so much uninformed criticism.  It&#8217;s kind of a Gresham&#8217;s Law&#8212;bad money drives the good money out of circulation.  Bad criticism drives good criticism out of circulation.  You just can&#8217;t criticize anything.<br />
