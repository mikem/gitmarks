      <p>When Guy Kawasaki blogged about the <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/01/ten_ways_to_use.html">Ten Ways to Use LinkedIn</a>, LinkedIn had 8.5 million users in 130 industries. Since then we&#8217;ve grown to over 12 million users covering 147 industries, but many of Guy&#8217;s suggestions on using LinkedIn (see below), still remain a great way for professionals to strengthen their online brand reputation and leverage their professional network. Happy Reading!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase your visibility.</strong>
<p>By adding connections, you increase the likelihood that people will see your profile first when they’re searching for someone to hire or do business with. In addition to appearing at the top of search results  (which is a major plus if you’re one of the 52,000 product managers on LinkedIn), people would much rather work with people who their friends know and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Improve your connectability.</strong>
<p>Most new users put only their current company in their profile. By doing so, they severely limit their ability to connect with people. You should fill out your profile like it’s an executive bio, so include<br />
past companies, education, affiliations, and activities.</p>
<p>You can also include a link to your profile as part of an email signature. The added benefit is that the link enables people to see all your credentials, which would be awkward if not downright strange, as<br />
an attachment.</li>
<li><strong>Improve your Google PageRank.</strong>
<p>LinkedIn allows you to make your profile information available for search engines to index. Since LinkedIn profiles receive a fairly high PageRank in Google, this is a good way to influence what people see when they search for you.</p>
<p>To do this, create a public profile and select “Full View.” Also, instead of using the default URL, customize your public profile’s URL to be your actual name. To strengthen the visibility of this page in<br />
search engines, use this link in various places on the web&gt; For example, when you comment in a blog, include a link to your profile in your signature.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance your search engine results.</strong>
<p>In addition to your name, you can also promote your blog or website to search engines like Google and Yahoo! Your LinkedIn profile allows you to publicize websites. There are a few pre-selected categories like “My Website,” “My Company,” etc.</p>
<p>If you select “Other” you can modify the name of the link. If you’re linking to your personal blog, include your name or descriptive terms in the link, and voila! instant search-engine optimization for your site. To make this work, be sure your public profile setting is set to “Full View.”</li>
<li><strong>Perform blind, “reverse,” and company reference checks.</strong>
<p>LinkedIn’s reference check tool to input a company name and the years the person worked at the company to search for references. Your search will find the people who worked at the company during the same time period. Since references provided by a candidate will generally be glowing, this is a good way to get more balanced data.</p>
<p>Companies will typically check your references before hiring you, but have you ever thought of checking your prospective manager’s references? Most interviewees don’t have the audacity to ask a<br />
potential boss for references, but with LinkedIn you have a way to scope her out.</p>
<p>You can also check up on the company itself by finding the person who used to have the job that you’re interviewing for. Do this by searching for job title and company, but be sure to uncheck “Current titles only.” By contacting people who used to hold the position, you can get the inside scoop on the job, manager and growth potential.</p>
<p>By the way, if using LinkedIn in these ways becomes a common practice, we’re apt to see more truthful resumes. There’s nothing more amusing than to find out that the candidate who claims to have caused some huge success was a total bozo who was just along for the ride.</li>
<li><strong>Increase the relevancy of your job search.</strong>
<p>Use LinkedIn’s advanced search to find people with educational and work experience like yours to see where they work. For example, a programmer would use search keywords such as “Ruby on Rails,” “C++,” “Python,” “Java,” and “evangelist” to find out where other programmers with these skills work.</li>
<li><strong>Make your interview go smoother.</strong>
<p>You can use LinkedIn to find the people that you’re meeting. Knowing that you went to the same school, plays hockey, or shares acquaintances is a lot better than an awkward silence after, “I’m doing fine, thank you.”</li>
<li><strong>Gauge the health of a company.</strong>
<p>Perform an advanced search for company name and uncheck the “Current Companies Only” box. This will enable you to scrutinize the rate of turnover and whether key people are abandoning ship. Former employees usually give more candid opinions about a company’s prospects than someone who’s still on board.</li>
<li><strong>Gauge the health of an industry.</strong>
<p>If you’re thinking of investing or working in a sector, use LinkedIn to find people who worked for competitors—or even better, companies who failed. For example, suppose you wanted to build a next generation online pet store, you’d probably learn a lot from speaking with former Pets.com or WebVan employees.</li>
<li><strong>Track startups.</strong>
<p>You can see people in your network who are initiating new startups by doing an advanced search for a range of keywords such as “stealth” or “new startup.” Apply the “Sort By” filter to “Degrees away from you” in order to see the people closest to you first.

      <p>Guy,<br />
Congrats to you and the team at LinkedIn.  I call it Facebook for adults with jobs.  While LinkedIn is a great concept, I wonder if we couldn&#8217;t improve the stickiness by incorporating Yelp-like functionality.  I realize that we can recommend each other, but frankly the recommendations appear to be a bit glib and superficial. And there is no apparent way to provide constructive or reasoned, critical feedback. If LinkedIn became a bona fide source of serious, critical reviews of people and companies both positive and not so positive I believe its usefulness would be enhanced tremendously.</p>

      <p>I want to congratulate you for your post. You gave an completed overview of the main points to use Linkedin.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think that Linkedin should not be use as a site within a SEO strategy. It is a fact that it has an impact but is should not be use with this objective.</p>
<p>As for a suggestion, I just would like to have more control over the information my contacts can see.</p>
<p>Also, I can see Linkedin in English but not in Spanish. I would like to let you know that I encouraged the use of  Linkedin for Spanish users with my blog:</p>

<p>I hope this helps. You increased a 300% your audience over the last year. Impressive job. Congratulations again.</p>

      <p>One of the most common responses I get when I talk to people about LinkedIn is this: &#8220;I&#8217;m a member, but I just really don&#8217;t know what to do with it.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also always wanted a way to respond to the nay-sayers, particularly in the blogosphere, who say that LinkedIn isn&#8217;t particularly useful.</p>
<p>With all due respect to Guy, he&#8217;s just scratching the surface. Collectively, we can come up with a lot more than 10 ways to use LinkedIn. So far, between a group blogging project, posts and articles I&#8217;ve been collecting, and a couple of my own writings, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of 80+ smart ways to use LinkedIn:</p>
<p><a href="http://LinkedIntelligence.com/smart-ways-to-use-linkedin" rel="nofollow">http://LinkedIntelligence.com/smart-ways-to-use-linkedin</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d be willing to bet that even for the most seasoned LinkedIn users, there are at least a couple of ideas in there you haven&#8217;t thought of yet.</p>

         July 30th, 2007                
        
      <p>Until now I was under the impression the idea of linked-in was to create a trusted network of people you actually know personally.<br />
The idea of &#8220;&#8230;By adding connections, you increase the likelihood that people will see your profile first when they’re searching for someone to hire or do business with&#8230;&#8221; means I should accept all those invitations I got from people who went to the same university as I did but I have never met or heard of.<br />
I&#8217;m proud to say that I personally know each person on my list &#8211; not necessarily recommend each one &#8211; but I will be able to give my personal opinion if asked.<br />
If everyone&#8217;s goal will be to add as many connections &#8211; I&#8217;m afraid those interested in quality and not quantity will need to go elsewhere for reliable information and Linked-in will be but just another community website.<br />
Linked-in can divide the connection list so when you add a new connection you can specify how well do you know them. A connection you&#8217;ve met at a conference and chatted for 10 minutes with should be in a different level than someone you&#8217;ve closely worked with for years.</p>

      <p>Great comment Ido &#8211; I agree it would be extremely helpful if there was a scale that you chose from that indicated how well you were really &#8216;linkedin&#8217; with the individual you accept an invitation from.  Even though you can deny an invite, that is just and either/or option.  Better would be one where you could choose on a scale of 1 &#8211; 5 (5 meaning a close contact you know well personally, and so on&#8230;).  This would help those who view other profiles to know when they might have a &#8216;real&#8217; second level connection or if it is just someone their link met at a meeting.</p>

      <p>First, am I the only one who is finding the size limitations of the fields very limiting? They seem draconian to me. I could have added bullet points describing some of the specific successes I&#8217;ve had as well as the tools I used in each position&#8211;which I&#8217;ve heard again and again from recruiters that they want to see that. The sizes of the messages sent through the site is also very tight.</p>
<p>I like the ideas put forth around being able to categorize the level of relationship with each connection, so the difference between someone I&#8217;ve known for 20 years and someone I worked with for a year are clear. I also like the idea of being able to choose to whom my contacts are visible, rather than an all-or-nothing setting like we have now.</p>
<p>I would also suggest like it to be possible for others to post recomendations or comments to other things besides jobs; for example, for an institution listed under &#8220;Education&#8221; or &#8220;Other Interests.&#8221; If I were to win a tournament in Toastmasters or chess or some sport, or release an album, those often involve other people and demonstrate important skills and attributes which are very much transferrable.</p>
<p>I can attest that many of my best job leads have come to me through this site. I, for one, think the designers have hit on something important which has been lacking.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

As a Healthcare Executive Coach, I plan on referring my clients to your blog, your words, and your advice.  I found it very easy to read and incredibly complete. Way to go!  You have provided a very good service to our networks and the public, especially those of us who really want to increase the effectiveness of LinkedIn as a personal and business tool.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>

      <p>Long before Guy Kawasaki blogged about the Ten Ways to Use LinkedIn he wrote a book on “marketing like an evangelist” called Selling The Dream. In it he tells the David and Goliath like tale of how a little company called Apple Computer rocked the world of the giant monopoly called IBM to become a world wide contender. Without the big advertising budget of the giant IBM the little company called Apple was forced to use the tactics of a grass roots marketer.  They gathered a following of dedicated believers, trusted associates and sincere promoters that grew into a virtual cult of evangelists.<br />
They did it by listening to what their market had to say and responding by including them in their promotion. The words, “your right” were used over and over to enlist millions to the cause. Satisfied customers weren’t customers any more they were the “idea people” who drove product development to unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction.<br />
Small networks of like minded people were linked together by a common bond to form a loyal customer referral system that was like no other.<br />
If you are interested in growing your business like Apple Computer did you would do well to read anything written by Guy Kawasaki including ten ways to use Linkedin.   <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2007/07/ten-ways-to-use.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2007/07/ten-ways-to-use.html</a>.</p>

      <p>A very impressive website and honestly, this is so far the best that I have seen in terms of quality of members.  As a Director of Sales in the largest private real estate developer in the Philippines,I intend to promote our projects to as many potential buyers and agents alike.  I believe overseas buyers deserve to know the best alternative to property investment. Century Properties is developing the Gramercy Residences at Century City in Makati and The Canyon Ranch subdivision in Carmona, Cavite.  For those who want to see some pics and other information just let me know so I can properly attend to you.</p>

      <p>Dear Mr Gates,</p>
<p>My answer is ‘Glamorize’ the field of Science and technology. To add more depth to the answer on ‘How?’ &#8211; We need to segment the ‘Young minds’ based on geography and economics taking the whole world as a platform. Universally there is one code – the T.V., Movies, Fashion and a great influence of parent’s profession and the surrounding environment which makes a mark at the formative stages. So, if we could segment the groups based on media influence, then we could do marvellous programmes, soaps, workshops, road shows, Mass gatherings, Government , NGO’s try encouraging marketers to dwell more on the product manufacturing when they advertise their products based out of science and technology. I remember growing on watching ‘Star Trek ‘every Sunday, it’s like I was fed with science fiction and I always look forward to that diet (though such fiction/ science is not so popular now – its taken the form of some U.F.O or Terminator type based movies). Ms Sunitha Williams from NASA (of Indian Origin) went to the Moon and was back and made it a point to visit India and gave complete picture of her experience, most media covered it 24&#215;7. It may not be a diet one likes, but sure inspires people- when we say we inspire people, it should not be volatile and just the top of the mind, and it should be able have a durable impact on the young minds so that they are able to make the solid decision that this is it – I am going to take this field because a) I have grown up with how glamorous this industry is. b) I know that it gives me financial benefits that make me stand up and may be make a historic mark. So when one is visibly able to see the impact one can make in this field one is sure to take it up.<br />
The number of people taking up science as their education or course has dropped. Science seems to be governed only by Government bodies and few companies, so there seems to be very less ‘Demand and supply’ gap. We need to create positions for a title as ‘Science Officer’. The term ‘Technocrat’ is a commonly known position but something like ‘Science Manager’, ‘Scientific programmer’, ‘Scientific developer’, ‘Science Minister’ (these titles have been created by me and out from my thoughts – so apologise if I offend any)- It is the responsibility of the corporate citizen and the governmental systems. I think ‘cos it is not ‘glamorised’ so much about and seems like Zoology is a Fossil and Botany is about vegetables and gardening, may be Chemistry is about that Uranium bomb – ‘oh! I saw it in the Holly wood movie’ and may be biology is about stem cells (We know what media reported when Mr. President – George Bush made comments on stem cell research) and so, ‘I am not going to pick up something like that ’and become extinct in this era of e-Commerce, Hi-tec city and in the Information age &#8211; so encouraging people to take up science is more harder, Technology is less challenging as most segments of people get exposed to technology in every walk of life . One can seemingly live without science or a life science as it already a road well led, well researched and at its pinnacle, but technology – No. One needs to keep changing their model of car they use, Plasma T.V. they watch , Mobile phones they use.So if we could just about take up Science as an area of ‘How’ to encourage and run for some time , may be Technology will just need walking. Thanks for the Q -Naga</p>

      <p>How can I add recommendations to my profile when I was a consultant?<br />
For example: I was an employee of Modis when I consulted at American Express for 7 years. I want to add recommendations from American Express management but there is no direct link to American Express.</p>

      <p>This was an excellent and helpful article now that I am  heavily involved in LinkedIn.  Chris Brogan of <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrisbrogan.com</a> first directed me to this article via his blog, and I now recommend others to read this article if they are truly interested in making LinkedIn work for them.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for sharing these tips!</p>
<p>Great success is inevitable if we all became LinkedIn power users.</p>
