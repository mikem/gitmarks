<B>About AutoDia</B>
<P>
AutoDia is a modular application that parses source code, XML or data and produces an XML document in Dia format (or images via 
graphviz and vcg). Its goal is to be a UML / DB Schema diagram autocreation package. The diagrams its creates are standard UML diagrams 
showing dependancies, superclasses, packages, classes and inheritances, as well as the methods, etc of each class.
<P>
AutoDia supports any language that a Handler has been written for - see below for an up to date list..
<P>
** current release is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/T/TE/TEEJAY/Autodia-2.03.tar.gz">version 2.03</a> (27th April 2007) **
<br>
<P>
Autodia now outputs the following formats :
<ul>
<li> Graphviz (using dot to generate jpg, png, etc)
<li> dot
<li> vcg
<li> xvcg (using xvcg to output postscript, etc)
<li> dia (using a new custom directed graph algorithm to layout diagrams)
<li> HTML/XML/Anything (if you write your own template)
<li> Experimental SpringGraph (native perl directed graphs similar to graphviz) now included
<li> Experimental Umbrello XML/XMI (requires fixing)
</ul>
<p>
Autodia now parses the following forms of input
<ul>
<li> Perl
<li> Python
<li> PHP
<li> Java (some issues with version 1.4) no longer fully supported (it used to work, Java broke its API's now it doesn't, fixes welcome)
<li> C++
<li> Torque (XML DB schema)
<li> DBI (perl database interface handles)
<li> SQL
<li> Umbrello (experimental)
</ul>
<p>
Note: you can add your own parser or language handler in under 20 minutes if you have reasonable knowledge of perl and in an evening if 
you have basic perl skills.
<br>
If you can hack perl then you should also be able to create a new output format relatively quickly - I would be very greatful if 
anybody was able to contribute argouml input/output for example.
<P>
cheers, hope you like it,<BR>
