<li><b><a href="http://www.icon.co.za/~psheer/rute-home.html" target="_blank">Linux: Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition</a></b> - Most IT books have to be rushed to keep up to date with the rapidly evolving trends in software. As technical books, they are usually of a low quality. Rute, on the other hand, was carefully mastered over three years to be a complete reference of Unix -- Unix itself has not changed fundamentally in many decades. The GNU project also tends toward enduring standards that evolve very slowly. On the other hand, there is much evolving with respect to RedHat, Debian, and Mandrake, so these peculiarities where written into the book as those distributions evolved. I believe there is here the best combination of reference and practical, current information. On another level, my working environment necessitated field experience that was ideal for a book like this. From rebuilding old 486 mail servers (while sitting on the floor in dusty filing rooms); to the creation of custom desktops and thin clients for word processing environments; to nation-wide WAN networks. My company's daring escapades tested human ingenuity and Linux dexterity in every conceivable environment. So quite simply, there is a lot more in Rute than you will find anywhere else. </li>

<li><b><a href="http://openbooks.sourceforge.net/books/wga/" target="_blank">Writing GNOME Applications</a></b>

- Programming with GNOME is no simple task for the uninitiated. GNOME

is one of the larger desktop programming suites you'll find. It has

taken two years and hundreds of programmers to become what it is now.

GNOME covers a lot of ground and makes use of many, many supporting

libraries. Despite its nec- essary complexity, however, GNOME is very

well laid out. It makes sense when you see it as a whole. On a

line-by-line basis the code is not arcane or obfuscated. It's actually

well written and quite nicely formatted. There's just so much of it!

This book will attempt to guide you through all the fundamental parts

of GNOME, to explain how things work and why. Rather than taking you

through an exhaustive listing of function calls and coding semantics,

we'll concentrate on what makes GNOME tick. We'll certainly go into

detail about the important function calls and how to use them, but

you'll still want to keep the official GNOME and GTK+ documentation on

hand. The official documents are free, just like the rest of GNOME, and

should even be bundled with your GNOME distribution.

When you finish with this book, you should have a very clear, intuitive

understanding of the GNOME 1.2 framework. You'll be able to write a

com- plete GNOME application, from front to back. If you run into

problems, you'll know how to diagnose the problem and where to look for

the answers. It's impossible to know absolutely everything, but this

book should at least iden- tify everything you need to know. </li>

2.0 Development</a></b>

- The K Desktop Environment (KDE) project is a worldwide collaboration

of hundreds of software engineers and hobbyists who are working to

create a free, modern desktop interface with a consistent graphical

user interface (GUI) style across applications. The desktop is network

transparent, meaning that remote and local files can all be viewed,

edited, and managed in the same way; it has online hypertext help and

features an integrated, full-featured Web browser. The purpose of this

book is to teach you how to take advantage of all that the KDE

libraries have to offer when you write your own applications.</li>

include application programs used as viewers of remote data, web

applications (including CGI scripts), network servers, and

setuid/setgid programs. Specific guidelines for C, C++, Java, Perl,

PHP, Python, Tcl, and Ada95 are included.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/" target="_blank">The

Art of Unix Programming</a></b>

- There is a vast difference between knowledge and expertise. Knowledge

lets you deduce the right thing to do; expertise makes the right thing

a reflex, hardly requiring conscious thought at all.

This book has a lot of knowledge in it, but it is mainly about

expertise. It is going to try to teach you the things about Unix

development that Unix experts know, but aren't aware that they know. It

is therefore less about technicalia and more about shared culture than

most Unix books &#8212; both explicit and implicit culture, both conscious

and unconscious traditions. It is not a &#8216;how-to&#8217; book, it is a &#8216;why-to&#8217;

book.

The why-to has great practical importance, because far too much

software is poorly designed. Much of it suffers from bloat, is

exceedingly hard to maintain, and is too difficult to port to new

platforms or extend in ways the original programmers didn't anticipate.

These problems are symptoms of bad design. We hope that readers of this

book will learn something of what Unix has to teach about good design.</li>

Linux Development Platform</a></b>

- The Linux Development Platform shows how to choose the best open

source and GNU development tools for your specific needs, and integrate

them into a complete development environment that maximizes your

effectiveness in any project. It covers editors, compilers, assemblers,

debuggers, version control, utilities, LSB, Java, cross-platform

solutions, and the entire Linux software development process.</li>



<li><b><a href="http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/index.html" target="_blank">Linux

Device Drivers, 2nd Edition</a></b> - As the popularity of the Linux

system continues to grow, the interest in writing Linux device drivers

steadily increases. Most of Linux is independent of the hardware it

runs on, and most users can be (happily) unaware of hardware issues.

But, for each piece of hardware supported by Linux, somebody somewhere

has written a driver to make it work with the system. Without device

drivers, there is no functioning system. Device drivers take on a

special role in the Linux kernel. They are distinct "black boxes" that

make a particular piece of hardware respond to a well-defined internal

programming interface; they hide completely the details of how the

device works. User activities are performed by means of a set of

standardized calls that are independent of the specific driver; mapping

those calls to device-specific operations that act on real hardware is

then the role of the device driver. This programming interface is such

that drivers can be built separately from the rest of the kernel, and

"plugged in" at runtime when needed. This modularity makes Linux

drivers easy to write, to the point that there are now hundreds of them

available.</li>
