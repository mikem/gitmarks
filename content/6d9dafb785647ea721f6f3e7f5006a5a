		In order to access your mailbox you will need 3 things:
		<ul>
			<li>An active internet connection (an embarrasing stage to miss sometimes!)</li>
			<li>The address of a mail server capable of relaying for you - usually provided by your dialup provider (e.g. mail.domain.ext)</li>
			<li>A valid email address (e.g. mail@domain.ext)</li>
		</ul>
		The first thing to do is to open a connection from your computer to your mail server.<br />
		<code>telnet mail.domain.ext 25</code><br />
		You should receive a reply like:<br />
		<code>Trying ???.???.???.???...<br />
		Connected to mail.domain.ext.<br />
		Escape character is '^]'.<br />
		220 mail.domain.ext ESMTP Sendmail ?version-number?; ?date+time+gmtoffset?</code><br />
		<br />
		You will then need to delcare where you are sending the email from:<br />
		<code>HELO local.domain.name</code> - dont worry too much about your local domain name although you really <i>should</i> use your exact fully qualified domain name as seen by the outside world the mail server has no choice but to take your word for it as of RFC822-RFC1123.<br />
		This should give you:<br />
		<code>250 mail.domain.ext Hello local.domain.name [loc.al.i.p], pleased to meet you</code><br />
		<br />
		Now give your email address:<br />
		(On many mailservers the space after the : is required rather that optional. Thanks to Justing Goldberg)<br />
		<code>MAIL FROM: mail@domain.ext</code><br />
		Should yeild:<br />
		<code>250 2.1.0 mail@domain.ext... Sender ok</code><br />
		If it doesn't please see <a href="#errors">possible problems</a>.<br />
		<br />
		Now give the recipients address:<br />
		<code>RCPT TO: mail@otherdomain.ext</code><br />
		Should yeild:<br />
		<code>250 2.1.0 mail@otherdomain.ext... Recipient ok</code><br />
		If it doesn't please see <a href="#errors">possible problems</a>. Note Google mail servers require &lt; and &gt; around the email address (thanks to Paul Beattie).<br />
		<br />
		To start composing the message issue the command <code>DATA</code><br />
		<br />
		If you want a subject for your email type <code>Subject:-type subject here-</code> then press enter twice (these are needed to conform to RFC 882)<br />
		<br />
		You may now proceed to type the body of your message (e.g. <code>hello mail@otherdomain.ext from mail@domain.ext</code>)<br />
		<br />
		To tell the mail server that you have completed the message enter a single &quot;<code>.</code>&quot; on a line on it's own.<br />
		The mail server should reply with: <code>250 2.0.0 ???????? Message accepted for delivery</code><br />
		<br />
		You can close the connection by issuing the <code>QUIT</code> command.<br />
		The mailserver should reply with something like:<code>221 2.0.0 mail.domain.ext closing connection<br />Connection closed by foreign host.</code><br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<a name="errors" /><h3>Here are a list of problems I've encountered and their fixes</h3>
		<code>501 nouser@nosuchplace.here... Sender domain must exist</code><br />
		The domain that you are sending from must exist<br />
		<br />
		<code>503 Need MAIL before RCPT</code><br />
		A recipient has been specified before a sender.<br />
		<br />
		<code>550 mail@domain.ext... Relaying Denied</code><br />
		The mail server has refused to relay mail for you, this may be for any number of reasons but typical resons include:<br />
		Not using this provider for an internet connection and/or<br />
		Not using an email address provided by the owner of the server.<br />
		<br />
		Some things to watch out for:<br />
		1. If you type too quickly, sometimes it won't recognise your text (weird!)<br />
		2. The backspace key sometimes does not work with some telnet clients (even though it may seem as though it does)<br />
		<br />
		I'll be putting more as and when I get them and figure out how to fix each problem.<br />
